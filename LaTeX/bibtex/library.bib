abstract = {By far, the most popular test for spatial correlation is the one based on Moran's (1950) I test statistic. Despite this, the available results in the literature concerning the large sample distribution of this statistic are limited and have been derived under assumptions that do not cover many applications of interest. In this paper we first give a general result concerning the large sample distribution of Moran I type test statistics. We then apply this result to derive the large sample distribution of the Moran I test statistic for a variety of important models. In order to establish these results we also give a new central limit theorem for linear-quadratic forms. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

@article{Mahmood2006,
abstract = {Station metadata plays a critical role in the accurate assessment of climate data and eventually of climatic change, climate variability, and climate prediction. However, current procedures of metadata collection are insufficient for these purposes. This paper introduces the GeoProfile as a model for documenting and visualizing enhanced spatial metadata. In addition to traditional metadata archiving, GeoProfiles integrate meso-scale topography, slope, aspect, and land-use data from the vicinity of climate observing stations (). We describe how GeoProfiles are created using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and demonstrate how they may be used to help identify measurement bias in climate observations due to undesired instrument exposures and the subsequent forcings of micro- and meso-environments. A study involving 12 COOP and US Historical Climate Network (USHCN) stations finds that undesirable instrument exposures associated with both anthropogenic and natural influences resulted in biased measurement of temperature. Differences in average monthly maximum and minimum temperatures between proximate stations are as large as 1.6 and 3.8 °C, respectively. In addition, it is found that the difference in average extreme monthly minimum temperatures can be as high as 3.6 °C between nearby stations, largely owing to the differences in instrument exposures. Likewise, the difference in monthly extreme maximum temperatures between neighboring stations are as large as 2.4 °C. This investigation finds similar differences in the diurnal temperature range (DTR). GeoProfiles helped us to identify meso-scale forcing, e.g. instruments on a south-facing slope and topography, in addition to forcing of micro-scale setting.

abstract = {Neighborhood walkability can influence physical activity. We evaluated the validity of Walk Score(®) for assessing neighborhood walkability based on GIS (objective) indicators of neighborhood walkability with addresses from four US metropolitan areas with several street network buffer distances (i.e., 400-, 800-, and 1,600-meters). Address data come from the YMCA-Harvard After School Food and Fitness Project, an obesity prevention intervention involving children aged 5-11 years and their families participating in YMCA-administered, after-school programs located in four geographically diverse metropolitan areas in the US (n = 733). GIS data were used to measure multiple objective indicators of neighborhood walkability. Walk Scores were also obtained for the participant's residential addresses. Spearman correlations between Walk Scores and the GIS neighborhood walkability indicators were calculated as well as Spearman correlations accounting for spatial autocorrelation. There were many significant moderate correlations between Walk Scores and the GIS neighborhood walkability indicators such as density of retail destinations and intersection density (p < 0.05). The magnitude varied by the GIS indicator of neighborhood walkability. Correlations generally became stronger with a larger spatial scale, and there were some geographic differences. Walk Score(®) is free and publicly available for public health researchers and practitioners. Results from our study suggest that Walk Score(®) is a valid measure of estimating certain aspects of neighborhood walkability, particularly at the 1600-meter buffer. As such, our study confirms and extends the generalizability of previous findings demonstrating that Walk Score is a valid measure of estimating neighborhood walkability in multiple geographic locations and at multiple spatial scales.},

As data from urban meteorological stations are typically eliminated or adjusted for use in continental and global analyses of climate change, few studies have addressed how temperatures are changing in the areas most vulnerable to the public health impacts of warming: large cities. In this study, temperature data from urban and proximate rural stations for 50 large US metropolitan areas are analysed to establish the mean decadal rate of change in urban temperatures, rural temperatures, and heat island intensity over five decades. The results of this analysis find the mean decadal rate of change in the heat island intensity of large US cities between 1951 and 2000 to be 0.05 °C and further show a clear division in temperature trends between cities situated in the northeastern and southern regions of the country.

Such reasoning has quickly found its way from academic studies to official policy in many countries. Do the likely savings from such containment warrant the required draconian policies? An empirical assessment of transport energy consumption arising from decentralization is used to address this question. Two contextual reviews - of the compact city case and the strength of decentralization - precede the assessment. The conclusion is that energy savings will be minimal and that other policies might be more fruitful.},

abstract = {This study presents partial energy budget evaluations for a dry east-west oriented urban canyon in Columbus, Ohio, based on canyon-top measurements of net radiation and the turbulent and circulation-related components of the sensible heat flux. While net radiation data were similar to those reported in previous studies, the sensible heat exchanges were small in absolute magnitude, showed a ldquoflatrdquo diurnal regime and were uncorrelated with the net radiation. These results suggest a minimal degree of coupling by heat exchange between the canyon air space and the urban boundary layer above roof level. Speculations are offered on the nature of the unmeasured residual in the canyon energy budget. Evidence suggests that both a substrate heat flux and a significant advective term (through the canyon ends and top) may be instrumental in accounting for the residual. However, definitive conclusions were precluded by the absence of simultaneous evaluations of all the energy budget components. The need for such studies at canyon sites with diverse structures and fabrics is emphasized.},

abstract = {This tutorial is an introduction to spatial data in R and map making with R's `base' graphics and the popular graphics package ggplot2. It assumes no prior knowledge of spatial data analysis but prior understanding of the R command line would be beneficial. For people new to R, we recommend working through an `Introduction to R' type tutorial, such as "A (very) short introduction to R" (Torfs and Brauer, 2012) or the more geographically inclined "Short introduction to R" (Harris, 2012). Building on such background material, the following set of exercises is concerned with specific functions for spatial data and visualisation. It is divided into five parts: *Introduction, which provides a guide to R's syntax and preparing for the tutorial *Spatial data in R, which describes basic spatial functions in R *Manipulating spatial data, which includes changing projection, clipping and spatial joins *Map making with ggplot2, a recent graphics package for producing beautiful maps quickly *Taking spatial analysis in R further, a compilation of resources for furthering your skills An up-to-date version of this tutorial is maintained at https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R and the entire tutorial, including the input data can be downloaded as a zip file, as described below. The entire tutorialwas written in RMarkdown, which allows R code to run as the document compiles. Thus all the examples are entirely reproducible. Suggested improvements welcome - please fork, improve and push this document to its original home to ensure its longevity. The tutorial was developed for a series of Short Courses put on by the National Centre for Research Methods, via the TALISMAN node (see geotalisman.org).},

@book{Yezer2012,
abstract = {Efforts to understand and promote energy efficiency in cities have focused on the design of structures, vehicle fuel efficiency, and modal choice. However, changes in energy policies can have effects on urban form that may either reinforce or offset the energy savings expected under the policy. At the same time, urban development policies have major effects on the use of energy for commuting and within households. The effects of housing and urban development policies on energy consumption and the effects of energy consumption policies on housing and urban development are both substantial but have been neglected in discussions of either energy or urban policy. Using numerical urban simulation models, it is possible to estimate the relation between energy policy and urban development and to trace the energy consumption implications of urban development policy. This article describes a new class of urban simulation models, called the urban energy footprint model (UEFM), which remedies this deficiency by relating the determinants of urban form, including energy cost, to total energy use for housing and commuting. The use of UEFMs is illustrated here by estimating the energy implications of three urban policies that can affect the spatial structure of the urban built environment: increasing open space, building additional highways, and promoting income growth. The use of the UEFM to trace the implications for urban development of energy policy is illustrated by estimating the effects of an increase in fuel taxation. The lesson of this exercise is that urban development policy has dramatic implications for energy use and conversely energy policy has important effects on cities.},

As data from urban meteorological stations are typically eliminated or adjusted for use in continental and global analyses of climate change, few studies have addressed how temperatures are changing in the areas most vulnerable to the public health impacts of warming: large cities. In this study, temperature data from urban and proximate rural stations for 50 large US metropolitan areas are analysed to establish the mean decadal rate of change in urban temperatures, rural temperatures, and heat island intensity over five decades. The results of this analysis find the mean decadal rate of change in the heat island intensity of large US cities between 1951 and 2000 to be 0.05 °C and further show a clear division in temperature trends between cities situated in the northeastern and southern regions of the country.

To avoid all of these problems or at least to better deal with them, the economist who is interested in giving advice to judges ought to advocate a rule of strict liability regarding invasions of real (i.e., material) property.

abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine the association between sense of community, walking, and neighborhood design characteristics. The current study is based on a sub-sample of participants (n=609) from the US Atlanta SMARTRAQ study who completed a telephone survey capturing physical activity patterns, neighborhood perceptions, and social interactions. Objective measures of neighborhood form were also computed. Univariate and multivariate models (General Linear Models (GLM)) were used to examine the association between sense of community (SofC) and aspects of the built environment, physical activity, and neighborhood perceptions. In multivariate models the impact on SofC was examined with progressive adjustment for demographics characteristics followed by walking behavior, neighborhood design features, neighborhood perceptions and time spent traveling in a car. After adjustment, SofC was positively associated with leisurely walking (days/week), home ownership, seeing neighbors when walking and the presence of interesting sites. SofC was also associated with higher commercial floor space to land area ratios (FAR) - a proxy for walkable site design that captures the degree to which retail destinations are set back from the street, the amount of surface parking, and urban design of an area. Conversely the presence of more mixed use and perceptions of steep hills were inversely associated with SofC. SofC is enhanced by living in areas that encourage leisurely walking, hence it is associated with living in neighbourhoods with lower levels of land use mix, but higher levels of commercial FAR. Our results suggest that in terms of SofC, the presence of commercial destinations may inhibit social interaction among local residents unless urban design is used to create convivial pedestrian-friendly commercial areas, e.g., providing street frontage, rather than flat surface parking. This finding has policy implications and warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {atiotemporal interdependence - i.e., that the outcomes, actions, or choices of some unit-times depend on those of others - is substantively and theoretically ubiquitous and central in binary outcomes of interest across the social sciences. However, most empirical applications omit spatial interdependence and, at best, treat temporal dependence as nuisance to be “kludged”; indeed, even theoretical and substantive discussion usually ignores (inter)dependence. Moreover, in the few contexts where spatial interdependence has been acknowledged or emphasized, such as in the social-network and policy-diffusion literatures, empirical models either do not fully reflect the simultaneity of the outcomes across units, or they do not recognize the endogeneity of the spatial lags which are used (appropriately) to model the interdependence. This paper notes and explains some of the severe challenges posed by spatiotemporal interdependence in binary-outcome models and then follows recent spatial-econometric advances to suggest two simulation-based approaches for surmounting the computational intensiveness of these models: classical recursive-importance-sampling (RIS) or Bayesian Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Serial autocorrelation in binary outcomes raises essentially the same challenges, so these strategies offer effective approach to temporal dependence as well. We provide Monte-Carlo comparisons of the performance of these alternative estimators for spatial probit, including comparisons to estimation-strategies blind to or na{\"{\i}}ve about (inter)dependence - i.e., omitting spatial lags or including them but treating them as exogenous regressors in standard probit estimation - and then we show how to apply related simulation methods to calculate estimated spatial effects of hypothetical shocks in terms of outcomes or probabilities of outcomes (with associated confidence/credibility regions) rather than only in parameter-estimate or latent-variable terms as in all prior spatial-probit applications. We illustrate with applications to U.S. states’ adoptions of legislative term-limits and to great-power decisions to enter World War I.},

@article{Pasqualetti2004,
abstract = {The article discusses how humans have always found ways to use wind power as a vital energy source. The wind helped humans explore the world; they had no other energy source. It continues to help us prepare foods and pump water. In some places, the wind is such a part of daily life that in its absence, silence blankets the landscape and puts us out of sorts. Putting the wind to work was our first conscious use of solar power. Perhaps the most widespread use of wind machines, at least in the United States, has been to pump water. Dotting the Great Plains by the hundreds of thousands, farm windmills--along with grain silos--were once as characteristic of the landscape as coal spoils were of Appalachia. Today, wind machines receive substantial notoriety and publicity, plus a controversial mix of support and resistance. Instead of a stream of water, modern wind machines are pumping a stream of electrons, a product proving to be a valuable asset to farmers who are trying to address present day economic realities of living off the land. The new appearance and mechanics of wind machines reflects their different role. Instead of producing mechanical power for the purposes of pumping and grinding, the new machines convert mechanical energy into electricity. Wind power's popularity is widespread and growing, a result of its increasing profitability and the perceived environmental benefits it engenders. It also results from the simple fact that, unlike fossil and nuclear fuels, wind is a widely available, familiar element of the environment. The first step is seemingly the easiest: finding it. Among other states attracting interest, Texas has been the pacesetter with more than {\$}1 billion in new wind investment and 1,293 MW installed, mostly in the western part of the state near such communities as Big Springs and McCamey. Construction of a typical 100 MW wind farm produces more than 50,000 days (approximately 419,020 manhours) of employment.

@article{Hu2009,
abstract = {Regional climate change was demonstrated to be likely influenced by anthropogenic dominated land surface processes. Urban heat island (UHI) is one of the important outcomes of such land surface processes induced by urbanization, and it is an urban climate phenomenon influenced by land use pattern and it represents the difference in albedo, roughness, and heat flux exchange of land surface. This study tries to examine the influence of land use change on UHI in greater Guangzhou from 1980-2007 by analysing Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+ and MODIS satellite data, meteorological records, and census data. An integrated and modified single-channel method was used to retrieve land surface temperature (LST). Decadal changes in land use fraction and UHI pattern show that cropland decreased in parallel to the increase in built-up area and the correlation coefficient reached 0.97. The UHI effect expanded from urban areas to surrounding suburban areas and countryside with an increase in land surface temperature (mean LST increased by 2.48 from 1990 to 2007) and a decrease in the green vegetation fraction (GVF) (mean GVF decreased by 0.16 from 1990 to 2007). The spatial heterogeneity of UHI expansion can be explained by spatial patterns of economic development, population increase, and abundance of vegetation cover. In addition, remarkable changes in air temperature due to relocation of meteorological stations are significant signals for detecting the influence of urbanization on urban heat island.

abstract = {Sampling of a population is frequently required to understand trends and patterns in natural resource management because financial and time constraints preclude a complete census. A rigorous probability-based survey design specifies where to sample so that inferences from the sample apply to the entire population. Probability survey designs should be used in natural resource and environmental management situations because they provide the mathematical foundation for statistical inference. Development of long-term monitoring designs demand survey designs that achieve statistical rigor and are efficient but remain flexible to inevitable logistical or practical constraints during field data collection. Here we describe an approach to probability-based survey design, called the Reversed Randomized Quadrant-Recursive Raster, based on the concept of spatially balanced sampling and implemented in a geographic information system. This provides environmental managers a practical tool to generate flexible and efficient survey designs for natural resource applications. Factors commonly used to modify sampling intensity, such as categories, gradients, or accessibility, can be readily incorporated into the spatially balanced sample design.},

Cap rates do not, by themselves, signal an over- or under-priced market, or a cyclical or secular trend. One needs to look at the connections between the capital markets and the real estate markets, and to look at the relative investment environment as captured by cap rate spreads--a good measure of the real estate risk premium. This paper presents an analysis of the interactions between the capital markets and property market fundamentals that drive asset pricing. The findings indicate that real estate in most property types still looks reasonably priced.},

abstract = {As a result of opposition, on the grounds of visual impact, to major wind energy installations on land, power companies are increasingly turning to off-shore sites for wind farm development. In most cases, the multiple turbines will be visible from the shore and hinterlands and opposition to the visual intrusion continues. This paper more firmly establishes the parameters of wind turbine visibility and impact at different distances from the viewer, under different lighting and atmospheric conditions and with moving or stationary blades. This is achieved through an on-line survey involving an 18 turbine wind farm at three different distances (4, 8 and 12 km), in five different lighting and weather conditions and in two different movement conditions. Distance and contrast were found to be very good predictors of perceived impact. There was a significant difference in impact between simulations with moving and stationary blades. Responses were also analysed according to local exposure, national exposure, interest level and age.},

While it is worthwhile to understand the properties of economic equilibrium, equilibrium concepts have dominated economic thought to the point that they have obscured some of the more important issues economists have always strived to understand. At least since Adam Smith’s time, economists have tried to understand the causes of prosperity, and how economic welfare can be enhanced, but these issues are best understood outside the equilibrium framework. The foundations provided by the Austrian school point toward ways that economic analysis can expand beyond the equilibrium framework.},

abstract = {Poverty maps provide information on the spatial distribution of living standards. They are an important tool for policymakers, who rely on them to allocate transfers and inform policy design. Poverty maps are also an important tool for researchers, who use them to investigate the relationship between distribution within a country and growth or other economic, environmental, or social outcomes. A major impediment to the development of poverty maps has been that needed data on income or consumption typically are available only from relatively small surveys. Census data have the required sample size but generally do not have the required information. This article uses the case of Ecuador to demonstrate how sample survey data can be combined with census data to yield predicted poverty rates for the population covered by the census. These poverty rates are found to be precisely measured, even at fairly disaggregated levels. However, beyond a certain level of spatial disaggregation, standard errors rise rapidly.},

abstract = {In many countries, the development of wind power capacity has proceeded more slowly than expected. Levels of public acceptance are usually considered primary indicators of support for wind power within society. Surveys generally show strong overall public support for wind power, while concrete projects are felt to suffer from the Not-In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) syndrome. This paper questions the significance of these outcomes. It argues that other barriers to wind power implementation exist beyond attitudes among the population. The argument is made that institutional factors have a greater impact on wind energy facility siting. We will discuss two examples of how institutional factors shape the level of support when implementing wind power.},

This has not been the case, however,with newermethods of spatial analysis in particular, spatial statistics. Only recently has this situation started to change. This paper documents the confluence of spatial statistics and urban analysis by first reviewing developments in spatial statistics, and then presenting examples of recent applications in urban analysis. The developments reviewed fall under the rubric of global and local forms of spatial analysis, and cover three major technical issues: spatial association, spatial heterogeneity and the modifiable areal unit problem. The examples highlight the relevance and usefulness of the techniques reviewed for urban transportation and land-use applications. The paper concludes with conjectures concerning future developments at the intersection of spatial statistics and urban analysis.},

abstract = {Past research suggests that mixed land-uses encourage non-auto commuting; however, the evidence remains sketchy. This paper explores this question by investigating how the presence of retail activities in neighborhoods influences the commuting choices of residents using data from the 1985 American Housing Survey. Having grocery stores and other consumer services within 300 feet of one's residence is found to encourage commuting by mass transit, walking and bicycling, controlling for such factors as residential densities and vehicle ownership levels. When retail shops are beyond 300 feet yet within 1 mile of residences, however, they tend to encourage auto-commuting, ostensibly because of the ability to efficiently link work and shop trips by car. The presence of nearby commercial land-uses is also associated with relatively low vehicle ownership rates and short commuting distances among residents of a mixed-use neighborhood. Overall, residential densities exerted a stronger influence on commuting mode choices than levels of land-use mixture, except for walking and bicycle commutes. For non-motorized commuting, the presence or absence of neighborhood shops is a better predictor of mode choice than residential densities.},

abstract = {Progress in urban climatology over the two decades since the first publication of the International Journal of Climatology is reviewed. It is emphasized that urban climatology during this period has benefited from conceptual advances made in microclimatology and boundary-layer climatology in general. The role of scale, heterogeneity, dynamic source areas for turbulent fluxes and the complexity introduced by the roughness sublayer over the tall, rigid roughness elements of cities is described. The diversity of urban heat islands, depending on the medium sensed and the sensing technique, is explained. The review focuses on two areas within urban climatology. First, it assesses advances in the study of selected urban climatic processes relating to urban atmospheric turbulence (including surface roughness) and exchange processes for energy and water, at scales of consideration ranging from individual facets of the urban environment, through streets and city blocks to neighbourhoods. Second, it explores the literature on the urban temperature field. The state of knowledge about urban heat islands around 1980 is described and work since then is assessed in terms of similarities to and contrasts with that situation. Finally, the main advances are summarized and recommendations for urban climate work in the future are made. Copyright © 2003 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to minimum temperature data from stations located in urban, suburban and rural areas in Istanbul to determine the existence and significance of trends, and the approximate years in which changes in the trends started. In addition, using a mesoscale atmospheric model, a sensitivity experiment was carried out to explore the atmospheric effects of urbanization in the city. Both statistical and modeling analyses indicated significant warming in the atmosphere over the urbanized areas. Mann-Kendall tests indicated statistically significant positive trends in the time series of the differences in minimum temperatures between urban and rural stations. Seasonal analyses showed that the urbanization effect on climate was most pronounced in summer. In most cases, the changes in the trends occurred in the 1970s and 1980s when the population growth rate in Istanbul increased dramatically. The model results exhibited a significant expansion of the urban heat island in Istanbul from 1951 to 2004, fairly consistent with the expansion of the city in this period. A two-cell structure for the urban heat island emerged at the reference level from the difference of the July simulations with current and past landscapes: one on the European side and the other on the Asian side of the city. The maximum reference-level temperature difference between the past and present simulations was found to be around 1 °C. The modeling experiment also indicated that the velocity of the prevailing northeasterly wind and the water vapor mixing ratio were both reduced over the city. The heating effect due to urbanization was found to penetrate about 600-800 m height in the atmosphere over the city, and the two surface heat island cells were found to combine aloft.

abstract = {This paper proposes an original and unified toolbox to evaluate financial crisis early-warning systems (EWS). It presents four main advantages. First, it is a model free method which can be used to assess the forecasts issued from different EWS (probit, logit, Markov switching models, or combinations of models). Second, this toolbox can be applied to any type of crisis EWS (currency, banking, sovereign debt, and so on). Third, it does not only provide various criteria to evaluate the (absolute) validity of EWS forecasts but also proposes some tests to compare the relative performance of alternative EWS. Fourth, this toolbox can be used to evaluate both in-sample and out-of- sample forecasts. Applied to a logit model for 12 emerging countries we show that the yield spread is a key variable for predicting currency crises exclusively for South-Asian countries. Besides, the optimal cut-off correctly allows us to identify now on average more than 2/3 of the crisis and calm periods.},

abstract = {Economic analyses of climate change policies frequently focus on reductions of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions via market-based, economy-wide policies. The current course of environment and energy policy debate in the United States, however, suggests an alternative outcome: sector-based and/or inefficiently designed policies. This paper uses a collection of specialized, sector-based models in conjunction with a computable general equilibrium model of the economy to examine and compare these policies at an aggregate level. We examine the relative cost of different policies designed to achieve the same quantity of emission reductions. We find that excluding a limited number of sectors from an economy-wide policy does not significantly raise costs. Focusing policy solely on the electricity and transportation sectors doubles costs, however, and using non-market policies can raise cost by a factor often. These results are driven in part by, and are sensitive to, our modeling of pre-existing tax distortions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Abstract: The transportation sector offers substantial potential for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission abatement, but widely divergent cost estimates complicate policy making; energy–economy policy modelers apply top-down and bottom-up cost definitions and different assumptions about future technologies and the preferences of firms and households. Our hybrid energy–economy policy model is technology-rich, like a bottom-up model, but has empirically estimated behavioral parameters for risk and technology preferences, like a top-down model. Unlike typical top-down models, however, it simulates technological change endogenously with functions that relate the financial costs of technologies to cumulative production and adjust technology preferences as market shares change. We apply it to the choice of personal vehicles to indicate, first, the effect on cost estimates of divergent cost definitions and, second, the possible response to policies that require a minimum market share for low emission vehicles.

abstract = {A frequent scenario in public decision-making is that of choosing between a number of proposed changes from the status quo. In such a case, stated preference surveys, such as the contingent valuation method, are often undertaken to assess the size of the benefits associated with each proposed change. For certain undesirable options, respondents may prefer the status quo; however, it may not be credible to directly elicit negative willingness to pay or willingness to accept to endure the change. This study, using contingent valuation, outlines an indirect means of measuring negative willingness to pay - for the problem of visual disamenity arising from alternative electricity transmission tower designs - based on the elicitation of indicators of how inconvenienced respondents would feel if a less preferred option were to replace the status quo; that is, the time and cost respondents were prepared to commit to opposing the change. The results show that taking account of negative willingness to pay matters and this significantly changes value estimates for some of the least liked options. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

abstract = {This paper seeks to determine the factors underpinning changes in regional specialisation patterns in the European Union between 1991 and 2002. First, we consider a set of determinants previously identified in the regional literature, including agglomeration effects and other specific regional factors (business cycle, amount of investment, etc.). However, we then also take into account the fact that the evolution in a region’s specialisation pattern may be affected by the specialisation behaviour of other regions. Thus, not only do we consider the pattern of evolution in a region’s most proximate neighbours but we also examine that of their regional peers, i.e., regions with a similar specialisation pattern independent of their location. Notwithstanding, our empirical evidence indicates that physical distance still plays a very significant, and even more influential, role than similarity in specialisation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

abstract = {Efforts to understand and promote energy efficiency in cities have focused on the design of structures, vehicle fuel efficiency, and modal choice. However, changes in energy policies can have effects on urban form that may either reinforce or offset the energy savings expected under the policy. At the same time, urban development policies have major effects on the use of energy for commuting and within households. The effects of housing and urban development policies on energy consumption and the effects of energy consumption policies on housing and urban development are both substantial but have been neglected in discussions of either energy or urban policy. Using numerical urban simulation models, it is possible to estimate the relation between energy policy and urban development and to trace the energy consumption implications of urban development policy. This article describes a new class of urban simulation models, called the urban energy footprint model (UEFM), which remedies this deficiency by relating the determinants of urban form, including energy cost, to total energy use for housing and commuting. The use of UEFMs is illustrated here by estimating the energy implications of three urban policies that can affect the spatial structure of the urban built environment: increasing open space, building additional highways, and promoting income growth. The use of the UEFM to trace the implications for urban development of energy policy is illustrated by estimating the effects of an increase in fuel taxation. The lesson of this exercise is that urban development policy has dramatic implications for energy use and conversely energy policy has important effects on cities.},

@article{Bronin2008,
abstract = {en years ago, a book called The Quiet Revolution in Land Use Control argued that states would soon take over localities' long-held power over land use regulation. In the authors' view, this quiet revolution would occur when policymakers and the public recognized that certain problems - like environmental destruction - were too big for localities to handle on their own. Although the quiet revolution has not yet occurred, this Article suggests that it will, and should, occur alongside the ever-growing green building movement. This movement presents practical and ideological challenges to our current system of regulating land use. This Article examines those challenges, which occur primarily as a result of the "locality" - the local administration and enforcement - of "traditional" land use laws such as zoning ordinances and design controls. It uses the green building example to rebut the post-quiet-revolution scholarly presumption that land use is, or should be, an inherently local function. Currently, traditional land use regulation takes place at the local level. As written and enforced, zoning and design controls laws create unnecessary conflict between the desire to live in safe, attractive, and culturally rich communities and the desire to make those communities environmentally responsible. This tension raises the question: how should our traditional land use laws change in light of growing evidence of the negative externalities of conventional construction? This Article argues that the dominant mode of land use regulation nationwide bars the reforms that environmentalists and the building industry have worked together to develop. Given the failures of local governments to facilitate green building, it argues that when the consequences of land use laws exceed local boundaries, "extra-local" regulation should be considered. Instead of either a regional or national approach, this Article takes up the quiet revolution's rallying cry that states should play a stronger role in shaping the way traditional land use laws respond to green building.},

The models explain financial stress using both public and proprietary supervisory data from systemically important institutions, regressing institutional imbalances using an optimal lag method. The Systemic Assessment of Financial Environment (SAFE) EWS monitors microprudential information from the largest bank holding companies to anticipate the buildup of macroeconomic stresses in the financial markets. To mitigate inherent uncertainty, SAFE develops a set of medium-term forecasting specifications that gives policymakers enough time to take ex-ante policy action and a set of short-term forecasting specifications for verification and adjustment of supervisory actions. This paper highlights the application of these models to stress testing and policy. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Despite numerous recent advances in spatial econometrics, the choice of spatial weights remains exogenously determined by the researcher in empirical applications. Bayesian techniques provide statistical evidence regarding the simultaneous choice of model specification and spatial weights matrices by using posterior probabilities. This paper demonstrates the Bayesian estimation approach in a spatial hedonic property model estimating the impacts of repeated wildfires on house prices in Southern California. We find that improper choice of spatial model and weights can result in up to 5 percent difference in estimated coefficients and in our case study up to a {\$}15 Million difference in total benefits of reducing wildfires in Los Angeles County.

Respondents who had appraised such property report that power lines can affect residential property value to varying degrees under certain circumstances and that the market value of these properties is, on average, 10.01{\%} lower than the market value for comparable properties not subject to the influence of high voltage power lines. Further, the results indicate that even appraisers who had not appraised such property believe that power lines contribute negatively to property value.

@article{Toke2005,
abstract = {This paper discusses the factors that influence the outcome of onshore windfarm planning application in England and Wales. Various qualitative and quantitative methods have been employed, including regression analysis. Strong associations have been discovered between the outcome of local authority planning decisions, the opinions of local planning officers, the opinions of parish councils where the proposed windfarms are to be sited and the opinions of landscape protection groups. The attitude of people in the immediate vicinity of proposed windfarms is found to be the most important influence on the decisions made by local authorities. However, the local perception of the economic impact is of crucial importance in forming this judgement, as is the national political environment. The expected attitude of Appeal Inspectors is also important. It is concluded that there is a lot that wind power developers could do to improve the prospects of planning success. This includes engaging in local [`]parish council' politics, talking to the closest residents to proposed schemes and encouraging local pro-wind power campaigns. Future projects are likely to be favoured by installing viewing towers at the tops of turbines to encourage visitors and in selling shares in the schemes to local people.},

abstract = {A Bayesian probit model with individual effects that exhibit spatial dependencies is set forth. Since probit models are often used to explain variation in individual choices, these models may well exhibit spatial interaction effects due to the varying spatial location of the decision makers. That is, individuals located at similar points in space may tend to exhibit similar choice behavior. The model proposed here allows for a parameter vector of spatial interaction effects that takes the form of a spatial autoregression. This model extends the class of Bayesian spatial logit/probit models presented in LeSage (2000) and relies on a hierachical construct that we estimate via Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We illustrate the model by applying it to the 1996 presidential election results for 3,110 U.S. counties. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We show that U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol can be rationalized under political economy considerations. The reason is that U.S. compliance costs exceed low willingness to pay for dealing with global warming in the U.S. The withdrawal had a crucial impact on the implementation design of the protocol prior to its likely ratification. The remaining non-EU Parties to the Kyoto Protocol gained veto bargaining power and, thus, were successful in asserting far-reaching concessions from the EU on sink credits and, in particular, on the tradability of emission rights. Taking these concessions into account, the Kyoto Protocol was essentially reduced to a symbolic treaty that codifies more or less business-as-usual emissions and makes compliance a rather cheap deal.},

@article{Colwell1990,
abstract = {Abstract. This study attempts to detect whether power lines, power line towers, or both have an impact on the selling price of proximate residential land and to measure the magnitude of these impacts if they exist. Secondly, it attempts to determine whether any impact which is found to exist is diminished through time possibly as the growth of trees obscures the view of towers and lines, as attitudes change, or as uncertainty about the effects diminishes. Finally, the extent to which the impact extends beyond lots with an easement is considered. Throughout, the focus is on the value of land even though the use of developed property sales would ordinarily preclude such a focus. The approach is that of a hedonic price index in which selling price is a Cobb-Douglas function of a number of property characteristics with land area being just one of the characteristics. By shifting the other property characteristic variables, it is possible to obtain predictions of land value alone.

The estimation of the appropriate spatial regimes spatial error model shows that the convergence process is different across regimes.

We also control the potential endogeneity problem in the estimation of their impact. Our estimation results indicate that significant convergence takes place, but that the funds have no impact on it. Simulation experiments show how investments targeted to the peripheral regions never spill over to their neighbours, which calls for a reconsideration of current regional policy tools.},

abstract = {Economic analyses of climate change policies frequently focus on reductions of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions via market-based, economy-wide policies. The current course of environment and energy policy debate in the United States, however, suggests an alternative outcome: sector-based and/or inefficiently designed policies. This paper uses a collection of specialized, sector-based models in conjunction with a computable general equilibrium model of the economy to examine and compare these policies at an aggregate level. We examine the relative cost of different policies designed to achieve the same quantity of emission reductions. We find that excluding a limited number of sectors from an economy-wide policy does not significantly raise costs. Focusing policy solely on the electricity and transportation sectors doubles costs, however, and using non-market policies can raise cost by a factor often. These results are driven in part by, and are sensitive to, our modeling of pre-existing tax distortions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Scientific interest in urban meteorology has increased because highly populated areas experience high vulnerability to pollution or heavy rain. However, compared to urban air quality or urban heat island (UHI) processes, the urban water vapour cycle is poorly understood because it has been investigated less due to the lack of upper-air measurements and the high sensitivity of surface measurements to local heterogeneities. In this paper, surface measurements of wind, temperature, pressure and humidity, as well as integrated water vapour (IWV) from GPS and MODIS and numerical simulations, have been used to investigate the urban cycle of water vapour in May and June 2004 during the VAPIC field experiment in the Paris area.The surface data show the typical characteristics of an urban area with the absence of water vapour sources and a UHI of about 6 °C at night. The urban IWV distribution differs completely, with an urban IWV excess on average between 1600 and 0600 UTC (with a maximum of about 1.5 kg m-2 at 0600 and 1700 UTC). No IWV difference between the urban and rural areas is found in the middle of the day. The numerical simulations reproduce accurately the urban IWV anomaly.Shallow surface wind convergence associated with the UHI during nighttime provides moisture from the rural areas. Urban areas are therefore under wind convergence for most of the time. The rural water vapour sources and the depth of the convergence control the amplitude of the urban IWV excess. At about 1200 UTC, entrainment at the top of the urban boundary layer is the key process that inhibits the urban IWV excess observed at night. Copyright © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = {A frequent scenario in public decision-making is that of choosing between a number of proposed changes from the status quo. In such a case, stated preference surveys, such as the contingent valuation method, are often undertaken to assess the size of the benefits associated with each proposed change. For certain undesirable options, respondents may prefer the status quo; however, it may not be credible to directly elicit negative willingness to pay or willingness to accept to endure the change. This study, using contingent valuation, outlines an indirect means of measuring negative willingness to pay - for the problem of visual disamenity arising from alternative electricity transmission tower designs - based on the elicitation of indicators of how inconvenienced respondents would feel if a less preferred option were to replace the status quo; that is, the time and cost respondents were prepared to commit to opposing the change. The results show that taking account of negative willingness to pay matters and this significantly changes value estimates for some of the least liked options. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

I argue that it has moved from the margins to the mainstream of applied econometrics and social science methodology.

For each of these phases I describe the main methodological focus and list major contributions. I conclude with some speculations about future directions.

abstract = {As a result of opposition, on the grounds of visual impact, to major wind energy installations on land, power companies are increasingly turning to off-shore sites for wind farm development. In most cases, the multiple turbines will be visible from the shore and hinterlands and opposition to the visual intrusion continues. This paper more firmly establishes the parameters of wind turbine visibility and impact at different distances from the viewer, under different lighting and atmospheric conditions and with moving or stationary blades. This is achieved through an on-line survey involving an 18 turbine wind farm at three different distances (4, 8 and 12 km), in five different lighting and weather conditions and in two different movement conditions. Distance and contrast were found to be very good predictors of perceived impact. There was a significant difference in impact between simulations with moving and stationary blades. Responses were also analysed according to local exposure, national exposure, interest level and age.},

abstract = {Proponents of wind power note that wind is a green energy source. Yet locating electrical generating windmills has become difficult in some localities because of potential negative externalities. We address why the NIMBY syndrome may arise when choosing site locations by addressing the perceived property rights of a viewshed, the role of compensation in a NIMBY impasse, and how concerns for the environment might lessen the compensation required. We use a willingness to accept framework to measure the compensation required to allow wind generation windmills to be built in the mountains of North Carolina. We find that individuals who perceive wind energy as a clean source of power require less compensation. Those who retire to the mountains or individuals who have ancestors from Watauga County require more compensation to accept windmills in their viewshed. In addition, we find in a bivariate-probit analysis that individuals who are more likely to participate in a green energy program are also more likely to allow electrical generation windmills in their viewshed, suggesting that the green vs. green environmental debate is overstated.},

abstract = {Public attitudes anywhere in Europe show moderate to strong support for the implementation of renewable energy. Nevertheless, planning wind power developments appears to be a complicated matter in most countries. The problems that have to be dealt with during decision making processes on the siting of wind turbines are usually referred to as mere [`]communication problems'. However, public attitudes towards wind power are fundamentally different from attitudes towards wind farms. This [`]gap' causes misunderstandings about the nature of public support for renewables. In particular where planners easily assume support for renewables can be generated by information campaigns emphasising the environmental benefits, whereas opposition to renewable energy schemes can be explained by a selfish [`]not in my backyard' attitude. Both explanations used by planners, authorities and, unfortunately, by many scholars, are falsified. Furthermore, policies that still take this [`]common knowledge' for granted can have negative consequences for the implementation rates of renewables. Visual evaluation of the impact of wind power on landscape values is by far the dominant factor in explaining why some are opposed to wind power and others are supporting it. Moreover, feelings about equity and fairness appear the determinants of [`]backyard' motives, instead of selfishness.},

@article{F.Dormann2007,
abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species' distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.},

abstract = {Over the last 50 years the developing world, much of which is located in (sub)tropical regions, has seen a dramatic growth of its urban population associated with serious degradation of environmental quality. The total number of (sub)tropical urban climate studies, however; is still small ({\&}lt;20{\%} of all urban climate studies). The available work is further biased towards descriptive studies rather than process work that seeks to indicate the physical climatology of (sub)tropical cities. The available results allow for a preliminary comparison with data from temperate latitudes. Urban heat island (UHI) intensities are generally lower compared to those of temperate cities with comparable population and show a seasonal variation with lower (higher) intensities during the wet (dry) season. (Sub)tropical population-based relations may exist but insufficient appropriate data is available to confirm a logarithmic relationship or systematic differences between different climate types. The (sub)tropical energy balance studies are biased towards dry, clear sky conditions. The amount of net radiation dissipated by sensible heat during daytime is about 40{\%} which is similar to values observed in (sub)urban areas of cities located in temperate climates. Energy partitioning is modulated by water availability and higher percentage of vegetation promotes latent heat flux at the expense of surface heat storage. The apparent strong influence of vegetation and water availability on the energy partitioning irrespective of the climate type, suggests vegetation to be an effective means to reduce heat storage uptake during daytime and hence has the potential to effectively mitigate the nocturnal heat island. It is important to ensure that the rapidly expanding cities of the developing world incorporate climatological concerns in their design to provide a better living and working environment for a large segment of the world's inhabitants.

abstract = {Environmental determinants of health are receiving growing attention in the literature, although there is little empirical research in this area. The Study on Environmental and Individual Determinants of Physical Activity (known as the SEID project) was a social ecological project that examined the relative influence of individual, social environmental and physical environmental determinants of recreational physical activity. It involved a community survey of 1803 healthy workers and home-makers aged 18–59 years living in a 408{\&}{\#}xa0;km2 area of metropolitan Perth, Western Australia. Physical environmental determinants were mainly conceptualised as spatial access to popular recreational facilities. Overall, 59{\%} of respondents exercised as recommended. Recreational facilities located near home were used by more respondents than facilities located elsewhere. The most frequently used facilities were informal: the streets (45.6{\%}); public open space (28.8{\%}) and the beach (22.7{\%}). The physical environment's directs the influence on exercising as recommended was found to be secondary to individual and social environmental determinants. Nevertheless, accessible facilities determined whether or not they were used and in this way, support and enhance the achievement of recommended levels of physical activity behaviour by providing opportunities. The results suggest that access to a supportive physical environment is necessary, but may be insufficient to increase recommended levels of physical activity in the community. Complementary strategies are required that aim to influence individual and social environmental factors. Given the popularity of walking in the community, it is recommended that greater emphasis be placed on creating streetscapes that enhance walking for recreation and transport.},

abstract = {Spatial econometrics has been criticized by some economists because some model specifications have been driven by data-analytic considerations rather than having a firm foundation in economic theory. In particular this applies to the so-called W matrix, which is integral to the structure of endogenous and exogenous spatial lags, and to spatial error processes, and which are almost the sine qua non of spatial econometrics. Moreover it has been suggested that the significance of a spatially lagged dependent variable involving W may be misleading, since it may be simply picking up the effects of omitted spatially dependent variables, incorrectly suggesting the existence of a spillover mechanism. In this paper we review the theoretical and empirical rationale for network dependence and spatial externalities as embodied in spatially lagged variables, arguing that failing to acknowledge their presence at least leads to biased inference, can be a cause of inconsistent estimation, and leads to an incorrect understanding of true causal processes.},

abstract = {In many countries, the development of wind power capacity has proceeded more slowly than expected. Levels of public acceptance are usually considered primary indicators of support for wind power within society. Surveys generally show strong overall public support for wind power, while concrete projects are felt to suffer from the Not-In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) syndrome. This paper questions the significance of these outcomes. It argues that other barriers to wind power implementation exist beyond attitudes among the population. The argument is made that institutional factors have a greater impact on wind energy facility siting. We will discuss two examples of how institutional factors shape the level of support when implementing wind power.},

@article{Cervero1997,
abstract = {The built environment is thought to influence travel demand along three principal dimensions —density, diversity, and design. This paper tests this proposition by examining how the ‘3Ds’ affect trip rates and mode choice of residents in the San Francisco Bay Area. Using 1990 travel diary data and land-use records obtained from the U.S. census, regional inventories, and field surveys, models are estimated that relate features of the built environment to variations in vehicle miles traveled per household and mode choice, mainly for non-work trips. Factor analysis is used to linearly combine variables into the density and design dimensions of the built environment. The research finds that density, land-use diversity, and pedestrian-oriented designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-auto travel in statistically significant ways, though their influences appear to be fairly marginal. Elasticities between variables and factors that capture the 3Ds and various measures of travel demand are generally in the 0.06 to 0.18 range, expressed in absolute terms. Compact development was found to exert the strongest influence on personal business trips. Within-neighborhood retail shops, on the other hand, were most strongly associated with mode choice for work trips. And while a factor capturing ‘walking quality’ was only moderately related to mode choice for non-work trips, those living in neighborhoods with grid-iron street designs and restricted commercial parking were nonetheless found to average significantly less vehicle miles of travel and rely less on single-occupant vehicles for non-work trips. Overall, this research shows that the elasticities between each dimension of the built environment and travel demand are modest to moderate, though certainly not inconsequential. Thus it supports the contention of new urbanists and others that creating more compact, diverse, and pedestrian-orientated neighborhoods, in combination, can meaningfully influence how Americans travel.},

@article{Handy2002,
abstract = {The link between the built environment and human behavior has long been of interest to the field of urban planning, but direct assessments of the links between the built environment and physical activity as it influences personal health are still rare in the field. Yet the concepts, theories, and methods used by urban planners provide a foundation for an emerging body of research on the relationship between the built environment and physical activity. Recent research efforts in urban planning have focused on the idea that land use and design policies can be used to increase transit use as well as walking and bicycling. The development of appropriate measures for the built environment and for travel behavior is an essential element of this research. The link between the built environment and travel behavior is then made using theoretical frameworks borrowed from economics, and in particular, the concept of travel as a derived demand. The available evidence lends itself to the argument that a combination of urban design, land use patterns, and transportation systems that promotes walking and bicycling will help create active, healthier, and more livable communities. To provide more conclusive evidence, however, researchers must address the following issues: An alternative to the derived-demand framework must be developed for walking, measures of the built environment must be refined, and more-complete data on walking must be developed. In addition, detailed data on the built environment must be spatially matched to detailed data on travel behavior.},

abstract = {Scientific interest in urban meteorology has increased because highly populated areas experience high vulnerability to pollution or heavy rain. However, compared to urban air quality or urban heat island (UHI) processes, the urban water vapour cycle is poorly understood because it has been investigated less due to the lack of upper-air measurements and the high sensitivity of surface measurements to local heterogeneities. In this paper, surface measurements of wind, temperature, pressure and humidity, as well as integrated water vapour (IWV) from GPS and MODIS and numerical simulations, have been used to investigate the urban cycle of water vapour in May and June 2004 during the VAPIC field experiment in the Paris area.The surface data show the typical characteristics of an urban area with the absence of water vapour sources and a UHI of about 6 °C at night. The urban IWV distribution differs completely, with an urban IWV excess on average between 1600 and 0600 UTC (with a maximum of about 1.5 kg m-2 at 0600 and 1700 UTC). No IWV difference between the urban and rural areas is found in the middle of the day. The numerical simulations reproduce accurately the urban IWV anomaly.Shallow surface wind convergence associated with the UHI during nighttime provides moisture from the rural areas. Urban areas are therefore under wind convergence for most of the time. The rural water vapour sources and the depth of the convergence control the amplitude of the urban IWV excess. At about 1200 UTC, entrainment at the top of the urban boundary layer is the key process that inhibits the urban IWV excess observed at night. Copyright © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = {Financial early warning (FEW) models aim to help companies recognize possible financial crises and reduce financial risks through generating FEW messages. The current FEW models are mainly constructed by a set of financial indicators and the predictive accuracy has only been verified by these financial indicators rather than non-financial indicators. The issue in such a situation is that these financial indicators can be controlled or manipulated by related senior managerial personnel of companies, and therefore, using only financial indicators to verify FEW models cannot ensure the reliability of predictive accuracy of the models. To handle this issue, this paper develops a new FEW logit model which has better predictive accuracy than existing ones. More importantly, we propose a new approach which verifies the predictive accuracy of the logit model by using non-financial efficiency indicators of data envelopment analysis. An empirical study on Chinese company datasets revealed that the accuracy rates of predictions of the proposed model, for in-sample and out-of-sample companies, are 97.1{\%} and 94.1{\%} respectively, higher than existing results. Using non-financial efficiency indicators, the verification rates for the prediction results of the logit model for in-sample and out-of-sample companies are 95.8{\%} and 96.2{\%}, respectively. The findings show that the proposed FEW logit model has improved the accuracy of prediction and stability; the approach which uses non-financial efficiency indicators to verify the results of FEW logit model has significantly ensured the reliability of the FEW models.},

One surface type for which there is very limited field data is the urban canyon, which consists of the walls of adjacent buildings, the horizontal street-level area separating them (roadways, gardens, parking lots, etc.) and the enclosed air volume. Here the storage heat flux of an urban canyon and the resulting OHM parameters are investigated with a numerical model of a dry urban canyon energy budget. Substrate heat fluxes are derived from simulated surface and substrate temperatures; the latter evolve through time according to the finite difference form of the Fourier heat conduction equation. When compared against measured fluxes, the model performed satisfactorily. Numerical experiments show significant effects on the OHM parameters due to changes in the ratio of building height to separation distance and building wall thermal properties. Effects of intermediate significance were attributable to canyon orientation, wind speed and the timing of the between-building air temperature regime. Air temperature and the timing of the wind speed curve showed only minor significance.},

abstract = {Conditional autoregressive models are commonly used to represent spatial autocorre- lation in data relating to a set of non-overlapping areal units, which arise in a wide variety of applications including agriculture, education, epidemiology and image analysis. Such models are typically specified in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, with inference based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. The most widely used software to fit such models is WinBUGS or OpenBUGS, but in this paper we introduce the R pack- age CARBayes. The main advantage of CARBayes compared with the BUGS software is its ease of use, because: (1) the spatial adjacency information is easy to specify as a binary neighbourhood matrix; and (2) given the neighbourhood matrix the models can be implemented by a single function call in R. This paper outlines the general class of Bayesian hierarchical models that can be implemented in the CARBayes software, de- scribes their implementation via MCMC simulation techniques, and illustrates their use with two worked examples in the fields of house price analysis and disease mapping.},

Because of this, he makes the same errors in his defense of Coase that permeate the Chicago paradigm. In particular, his defense of Coasean type analysis completely ignores Austrian cost theory, i.e., that all economically relevant costs are strictly subjective and therefore conceptually impossible to measure. He also fails to grasp the implications of disequilibrium market process theory for the use of any kind of least-cost-avoider rule in the economic analysis of the law. As a result, Gunning's defense of Coase suffers from the same “pretense of knowledge” as the analysis that he is defending.},

abstract = {Over the last 50 years the developing world, much of which is located in (sub)tropical regions, has seen a dramatic growth of its urban population associated with serious degradation of environmental quality. The total number of (sub)tropical urban climate studies, however; is still small ({\&}lt;20{\%} of all urban climate studies). The available work is further biased towards descriptive studies rather than process work that seeks to indicate the physical climatology of (sub)tropical cities. The available results allow for a preliminary comparison with data from temperate latitudes. Urban heat island (UHI) intensities are generally lower compared to those of temperate cities with comparable population and show a seasonal variation with lower (higher) intensities during the wet (dry) season. (Sub)tropical population-based relations may exist but insufficient appropriate data is available to confirm a logarithmic relationship or systematic differences between different climate types. The (sub)tropical energy balance studies are biased towards dry, clear sky conditions. The amount of net radiation dissipated by sensible heat during daytime is about 40{\%} which is similar to values observed in (sub)urban areas of cities located in temperate climates. Energy partitioning is modulated by water availability and higher percentage of vegetation promotes latent heat flux at the expense of surface heat storage. The apparent strong influence of vegetation and water availability on the energy partitioning irrespective of the climate type, suggests vegetation to be an effective means to reduce heat storage uptake during daytime and hence has the potential to effectively mitigate the nocturnal heat island. It is important to ensure that the rapidly expanding cities of the developing world incorporate climatological concerns in their design to provide a better living and working environment for a large segment of the world's inhabitants.

More specifically, the evidence generated indicate that four Out of the five variables used in the estimation i.e. government spending on capital formation, development assistance, private investment and trade-openness all have positive and significant effect on economic growth.

In this paper, we suggest a framework that allows testing simultaneously for temporal heterogeneity, spatial heterogeneity, and spatial autocorrelation in beta-convergence models. Based on a sample of 145 European regions over the 1980-1999 period, we estimate a Seemingly Unrelated Regression Model with spatial regimes and spatial autocorrelation for two sub-periods: 1980-1989 and 1989-1999. The assumption of temporal independence between the two periods is rejected, and the estimation results point to the presence of spatial error autocorrelation in both sub-periods and spatial instability in the second sub-period, indicating the formation of a convergence club between the peripheral regions of the European Union.},

Despite numerous recent advances in spatial econometrics, the choice of spatial weights remains exogenously determined by the researcher in empirical applications. Bayesian techniques provide statistical evidence regarding the simultaneous choice of model specification and spatial weights matrices by using posterior probabilities. This paper demonstrates the Bayesian estimation approach in a spatial hedonic property model estimating the impacts of repeated wildfires on house prices in Southern California. We find that improper choice of spatial model and weights can result in up to 5 percent difference in estimated coefficients and in our case study up to a {\$}15 Million difference in total benefits of reducing wildfires in Los Angeles County.

@article{Bronin2008,
abstract = {en years ago, a book called The Quiet Revolution in Land Use Control argued that states would soon take over localities' long-held power over land use regulation. In the authors' view, this quiet revolution would occur when policymakers and the public recognized that certain problems - like environmental destruction - were too big for localities to handle on their own. Although the quiet revolution has not yet occurred, this Article suggests that it will, and should, occur alongside the ever-growing green building movement. This movement presents practical and ideological challenges to our current system of regulating land use. This Article examines those challenges, which occur primarily as a result of the "locality" - the local administration and enforcement - of "traditional" land use laws such as zoning ordinances and design controls. It uses the green building example to rebut the post-quiet-revolution scholarly presumption that land use is, or should be, an inherently local function. Currently, traditional land use regulation takes place at the local level. As written and enforced, zoning and design controls laws create unnecessary conflict between the desire to live in safe, attractive, and culturally rich communities and the desire to make those communities environmentally responsible. This tension raises the question: how should our traditional land use laws change in light of growing evidence of the negative externalities of conventional construction? This Article argues that the dominant mode of land use regulation nationwide bars the reforms that environmentalists and the building industry have worked together to develop. Given the failures of local governments to facilitate green building, it argues that when the consequences of land use laws exceed local boundaries, "extra-local" regulation should be considered. Instead of either a regional or national approach, this Article takes up the quiet revolution's rallying cry that states should play a stronger role in shaping the way traditional land use laws respond to green building.},

The empirical results, using two new approaches, confirm that more specialized university production yields relatively higher performance on average than less specialized production. The results also highlight certain advantages of financial ratios modelling.},

abstract = {Using a spatial econometric perspective, the speed of convergence for a sample of 163 regions of the European Union (EU) over the period 1981-1996 is estimated. For this purpose, we use a specification strategy which allows an explicit modeling of both spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation found in the analyzed sample. The estimated final model combines groupwise heterocedasticity, the identification of two spatial regimes and spatial dependence. Our results show how an appropriate consideration of the role of spatial effects can shed new insights into the European convergence process. We find that regions in the EU cohesion-fund countries (Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain) are converging separately from the rest of regions of the EU. Our estimations indicate that over the analyzed period, there was a faster conditional convergence in relative income levels of the regions belonging to Cohesion countries (5.3{\%}) than in the rest of the regions of the EU (3.3{\%}). Therefore, our results contrast with other evidence that points to the fact that the convergence process in Europe has weakened or even has stopped at the beginning of the 1980s. Moreover, our work shows clear evidence of separate spatial convergence clubs among EU regions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract. In this paper, we suggest a framework that allows testing simultaneously for temporal heterogeneity, spatial heterogeneity, and spatial autocorrelation in beta-convergence models. Based on a sample of 145 European regions over the 1980-1999 period, we estimate a Seemingly Unrelated Regression Model with spatial regimes and spatial autocorrelation for two sub-periods: 1980-1989 and 1989-1999. The assumption of temporal independence between the two periods is rejected, and the estimation results point to the presence of spatial error autocorrelation in both sub-periods and spatial instability in the second sub-period, indicating the formation of a convergence club between the peripheral regions of the European Union.},

@article{Devine-Wright2005,
abstract = {It is widely recognised that public acceptability often poses a barrier towards renewable energy development. This article reviews existing research on public perceptions of wind energy, where opposition is typically characterized by the NIMBY (not in my back yard) concept. The objectives of the article are to provide a critical assessment of past research and an integrated, multidimensional framework to guide future work. Six distinct strands of research are identified, summarized and critiqued: public support for switching from conventional energy sources to wind energy; aspects of turbines associated with negative perceptions; the impact of physical proximity to turbines; acceptance over time of wind farms; NIMBYism as an explanation for negative perceptions; and, finally, the impact of local involvement on perceptions. Research across these strands is characterized by opinion poll studies of general beliefs and case studies of perceptions of specific developments. In both cases, research is fragmented and has failed to adequately explain, rather than merely describe, perceptual processes. The article argues for more theoretically informed empirical research, grounded in social science concepts and methods. A multidimensional framework is proposed that goes beyond the NIMBY label and integrates previous findings with social and environmental psychological theory.

@article{Lamptey2009,
abstract = {The surface energy budget has been used to illustrate the influence of urban landscape on both global and regional climate. This was done using empirical as well as remotely sensed data of components of the surface energy equation.At the global scale, the urban land cover has the least impact on the sensible and latent heat fluxes compared to the other land cover types. Replacing the urban land cover with vegetation did not result in a significant change to the proportionate values of the turbulent fluxes originally due to vegetation. The least impact of current urbanization on the global climate in terms of radiation and surface fluxes is because the urban land cover has the smallest fraction of all the land cover types.The relative importance of the urban landscape at the regional scale was illustrated using the example of Chester County and surroundings near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the USA. The urban effect becomes more important as the fraction of urban land cover to the total increases. This is illustrated by computing turbulent fluxes for 1987, 1988, 1991, 1993 and 1996 over the Chester County area. Urbanization in Chester County and surrounding areas increased from 11{\%} in 1987 to 19{\%} in 1996. In 1996, urban land cover produced the largest proportionate sensible (21.4 Wm-2) and latent (14.2 Wm-2) heat fluxes during winter. During the 1996 summer, urban and vegetation land cover produced the largest proportionate sensible heat (59.2 Wm-2) while urban land cover produced the second largest proportionate latent heat flux (39.5 Wm-2). The implications of this simple analytical study point to the need to account for the urban landscape particularly in regional studies. Copyright © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = {A spatial-temporal Markov random-field model is used to produce indices for residential real estate from repeat home sale data. A set of regions is represented by a graph in which neighboring regions are linked. This graph, repeated consecutively a number of times, with each region linked to the same region at adjacent times, defines a spatial-temporal graph that connects regions over space and time in which each node represents a region at a particular time. An index is defined at each node to be the rate of appreciation of log sale price in a region during the preceding time interval. The indices are estimated from data consisting of repeat home sales. The Markov random-field model specifies spatial and temporal correlations between neighboring indices and relations between indices and individual repeat sales. A method is proposed for estimating various parameters in the model and for obtaining real-estate indices. Following this prescription, indices are calculated for the Dade County, Florida, residential real-estate market. Results are compared to those obtained using competing space-only models.},

abstract = {Sampling of a population is frequently required to understand trends and patterns in natural resource management because financial and time constraints preclude a complete census. A rigorous probability-based survey design specifies where to sample so that inferences from the sample apply to the entire population. Probability survey designs should be used in natural resource and environmental management situations because they provide the mathematical foundation for statistical inference. Development of long-term monitoring designs demand survey designs that achieve statistical rigor and are efficient but remain flexible to inevitable logistical or practical constraints during field data collection. Here we describe an approach to probability-based survey design, called the Reversed Randomized Quadrant-Recursive Raster, based on the concept of spatially balanced sampling and implemented in a geographic information system. This provides environmental managers a practical tool to generate flexible and efficient survey designs for natural resource applications. Factors commonly used to modify sampling intensity, such as categories, gradients, or accessibility, can be readily incorporated into the spatially balanced sample design.},

abstract = {In this study, local government digital spatial data are used to describe urban geometry and analyse spatial variations of the urban climate within the central areas of G{\"{o}}teborg, Sweden. A high-resolution raster digital elevation model (1 m pixel resolution) consisting of building structures and ground heights is derived from a local government geo-database, as well as land use patterns and artificial heat sources. Parameters such as the sky view factor (SVF) and daily averages of solar radiation are calculated. Results obtained from the model are compared with intra-urban air temperature variations which are derived from mobile measurements, as well as surface temperature variations derived from thermal infrared images. Results show that high-resolution digital elevation models in raster format are very useful sources of data for the investigation of intra-urban temperature variations. Results also show that the areal mean of SVF correlates with intra-urban air temperature variations to a higher degree than SVF that is taken from a point source location. The correlation between the modelled SVF and surface temperature is high during both spring and winter. Adding information about daily averages of global radiation for the spring measurement causes the correlation between SVF and surface temperature variations to increase.

@article{Abreu2004,
abstract = {This paper reviews the empirical literature on growth and convergence that has addressed the importance of spatial factors. An important distinction in this literature is the one between absolute and relative location. The literature on absolute location predominantly uses nonspatial econometric techniques, and is strongly linked to the economic growth literature. In contrast, studies on relative location tend to be weakly linked to theory, but apply relatively sophisticated econometric techniques to account for spatial effects. Most studies of the latter type are regional in nature, although there is a growing interest in extending the analysis to a cross-country setting. Both regional and cross-country studies typically make use of so-called spatial process models. Rather than modelling the impediments of space and distance directly, spatial process models start from exogenously provided information about the spatial structure. Our review shows that the usage of simple spatial autoregressive lag and error models abounds in the spatial econometrics literature. We assess the appropriateness of such models, and identify areas of potential concern. The rather weak linkage between theory and operational models, the dominance of global over local spatial association patterns, and the implicit restrictions on spatial interaction induced by many of the habitual specifications of the spatial weights matrix concurrently constitute areas where improvements can be made.},

In this paper we first give a general result concerning the large sample distribution of Moran I type test statistics.

In order to establish these results we also give a new central limit theorem for linear-quadratic forms. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

While net radiation data were similar to those reported in previous studies, the sensible heat exchanges were small in absolute magnitude, showed a ldquoflatrdquo diurnal regime and were uncorrelated with the net radiation. These results suggest a minimal degree of coupling by heat exchange between the canyon air space and the urban boundary layer above roof level. Speculations are offered on the nature of the unmeasured residual in the canyon energy budget. Evidence suggests that both a substrate heat flux and a significant advective term (through the canyon ends and top) may be instrumental in accounting for the residual. However, definitive conclusions were precluded by the absence of simultaneous evaluations of all the energy budget components. The need for such studies at canyon sites with diverse structures and fabrics is emphasized.},

@article{Boer2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite substantial evidence for neighborhood characteristics correlating with walking, so far there has been limited attention to possible practical implications for neighborhood design. This study investigates to what extent design guidelines are likely to stimulate walking.

METHODS: Four of the New Urbanism Smart Scorecard criteria and two other measures were tested for their influence on walking. Data were obtained from the 1995 National Personal Transportation Survey, U.S. Census 2000, and InfoUSA. Propensity-score methodology was used to control for potential confounders.

RESULTS: Higher levels of business diversity and higher percentages of four-way intersections were associated with more walking. For example, the odds ratio (OR) for walking in a neighborhood with four business types present compared to three business types was 1.24 (confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.44) and neighborhoods with 50{\%}-74{\%} four-way intersections had an OR for walking of 1.4 (CI 1.09-1.78) relative to those with 25{\%}-49{\%} four-way intersections. The effects of housing density on walking are mixed. Higher parking pressure and older median housing age did not significantly affect walking after covariate adjustment. Block length did not appear to be associated with walking.

CONCLUSIONS: When considering the New Urbanism Smart Scorecard from the perspective walking, some, but not all, of its criteria that appear to have a correlation with walking are likely to be useful for designing walkable communities.},

@article{Ezber2007,
abstract = {Statistical and numerical modeling tools were used to investigate the climatic effects of urbanization in Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey. Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to minimum temperature data from stations located in urban, suburban and rural areas in Istanbul to determine the existence and significance of trends, and the approximate years in which changes in the trends started. In addition, using a mesoscale atmospheric model, a sensitivity experiment was carried out to explore the atmospheric effects of urbanization in the city. Both statistical and modeling analyses indicated significant warming in the atmosphere over the urbanized areas. Mann-Kendall tests indicated statistically significant positive trends in the time series of the differences in minimum temperatures between urban and rural stations. Seasonal analyses showed that the urbanization effect on climate was most pronounced in summer. In most cases, the changes in the trends occurred in the 1970s and 1980s when the population growth rate in Istanbul increased dramatically. The model results exhibited a significant expansion of the urban heat island in Istanbul from 1951 to 2004, fairly consistent with the expansion of the city in this period. A two-cell structure for the urban heat island emerged at the reference level from the difference of the July simulations with current and past landscapes: one on the European side and the other on the Asian side of the city. The maximum reference-level temperature difference between the past and present simulations was found to be around 1 °C. The modeling experiment also indicated that the velocity of the prevailing northeasterly wind and the water vapor mixing ratio were both reduced over the city. The heating effect due to urbanization was found to penetrate about 600-800 m height in the atmosphere over the city, and the two surface heat island cells were found to combine aloft.

abstract = {A vast literature in statistics, biometrics, and econometrics is concerned with the analysis of binary and polychotomous response data. The classical approach fits a categorical response regression model using maximum likelihood, and inferences about the model are based on the associated asymptotic theory. The accuracy of classical confidence statements is questionable for small sample sizes. In this article, exact Bayesian methods for modeling categorical response data are developed using the idea of data augmentation. The general approach can be summarized as follows. The probit regression model for binary outcomes is seen to have an underlying normal regression structure on latent continuous data. Values of the latent data can be simulated from suitable truncated normal distributions. If the latent data are known, then the posterior distribution of the parameters can be computed using standard results for normal linear models. Draws from this posterior are used to sample new latent data, and the process is iterated with Gibbs sampling. This data augmentation approach provides a general framework for analyzing binary regression models. It leads to the same simplification achieved earlier for censored regression models. Under the proposed framework, the class of probit regression models can be enlarged by using mixtures of normal distributions to model the latent data. In this normal mixture class, one can investigate the sensitivity of the parameter estimates to the choice of "link function," which relates the linear regression estimate to the fitted probabilities. In addition, this approach allows one to easily fit Bayesian hierarchical models. One specific model considered here reflects the belief that the vector of regression coefficients lies on a smaller dimension linear subspace. The methods can also be generalized to multinomial response models with {\$}J > 2{\$} categories. In the ordered multinomial model, the J categories are ordered and a model is written linking the cumulative response probabilities with the linear regression structure. In the unordered multinomial model, the latent variables have a multivariate normal distribution with unknown variance-covariance matrix. For both multinomial models, the data augmentation method combined with Gibbs sampling is outlined. This approach is especially attractive for the multivariate probit model, where calculating the likelihood can be difficult.},

abstract = {Station metadata plays a critical role in the accurate assessment of climate data and eventually of climatic change, climate variability, and climate prediction. However, current procedures of metadata collection are insufficient for these purposes. This paper introduces the GeoProfile as a model for documenting and visualizing enhanced spatial metadata. In addition to traditional metadata archiving, GeoProfiles integrate meso-scale topography, slope, aspect, and land-use data from the vicinity of climate observing stations (). We describe how GeoProfiles are created using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and demonstrate how they may be used to help identify measurement bias in climate observations due to undesired instrument exposures and the subsequent forcings of micro- and meso-environments. A study involving 12 COOP and US Historical Climate Network (USHCN) stations finds that undesirable instrument exposures associated with both anthropogenic and natural influences resulted in biased measurement of temperature. Differences in average monthly maximum and minimum temperatures between proximate stations are as large as 1.6 and 3.8 °C, respectively. In addition, it is found that the difference in average extreme monthly minimum temperatures can be as high as 3.6 °C between nearby stations, largely owing to the differences in instrument exposures. Likewise, the difference in monthly extreme maximum temperatures between neighboring stations are as large as 2.4 °C. This investigation finds similar differences in the diurnal temperature range (DTR). GeoProfiles helped us to identify meso-scale forcing, e.g. instruments on a south-facing slope and topography, in addition to forcing of micro-scale setting.

We first note that the weak double dividend, the proposition that the welfare improvement from a tax reform where environmental taxes are used to lower distorting taxes must be greater than the welfare improvement from a reform where the environmental taxes are returned in a lump sum fashion, need not hold in a world with multiple distortions. We then present a large-scale computable general equilibrium model of the world economy with distortionary taxation. We use this model to evaluate a number of policies to reduce carbon emissions. We find that the weak double dividend is not obtained in a number of European countries. Results also demonstrate the point that the interplay between carbon policies and pre-existing taxes can differ markedly across countries. Thus, one must be cautious in extrapolating the results from a country specific analysis to other countries.},

This study aims at investigating an optimal land use in urban areas from the viewpoint of reducing energy consumption for transportation. For this purpose, the authors developed two kinds of models. One minimizes the total trip length under the condition of constant congestion. The other minimizes the fuel consumption directly where congestion is taken into account endogenously. The optimal structures calculated numerically illustrate that business areas are located around the center of a city while residential areas are on the suburbs, which is similar to the actual land use observed generally. These results are compared with the land use of the central business district (CBD) in Tokyo.},

We conclude that failure to correctly model spatial dependence can lead to differences in WTP estimates with potentially important policy ramifications.},

@article{Cervero1996,
abstract = {Past research suggests that mixed land-uses encourage non-auto commuting; however, the evidence remains sketchy. This paper explores this question by investigating how the presence of retail activities in neighborhoods influences the commuting choices of residents using data from the 1985 American Housing Survey. Having grocery stores and other consumer services within 300 feet of one's residence is found to encourage commuting by mass transit, walking and bicycling, controlling for such factors as residential densities and vehicle ownership levels. When retail shops are beyond 300 feet yet within 1 mile of residences, however, they tend to encourage auto-commuting, ostensibly because of the ability to efficiently link work and shop trips by car. The presence of nearby commercial land-uses is also associated with relatively low vehicle ownership rates and short commuting distances among residents of a mixed-use neighborhood. Overall, residential densities exerted a stronger influence on commuting mode choices than levels of land-use mixture, except for walking and bicycle commutes. For non-motorized commuting, the presence or absence of neighborhood shops is a better predictor of mode choice than residential densities.},

abstract = {There is growing concern about the negative environmental and energy effects caused by transportation systems and related land-use patterns. Travel and land-use are a function of one another, therefore it is often hypothesized that changing urban structure can result in changes in energy consumption. A popular view suggests that there is a strong negative correlation between urban density and energy consumption. This implies that increasing density will result in a reduction in energy consumption [Cities and Automobile Dependence: An International Sourcebook, Avebury Technical, Great Britain, 1989].

Using Co-Plot, an innovative multivariate statistical technique, this research crystallizes some of the relationships between density and energy consumption in western cities. The method is applied on Newman and Kenworthy’s data, leading to the conclusion that there is no direct impact of total urban density. Instead several other relationships between energy consumption and density attributes can be identified.},

abstract = {Poverty maps provide information on the spatial distribution of living standards. They are an important tool for policymakers, who rely on them to allocate transfers and inform policy design. Poverty maps are also an important tool for researchers, who use them to investigate the relationship between distribution within a country and growth or other economic, environmental, or social outcomes. A major impediment to the development of poverty maps has been that needed data on income or consumption typically are available only from relatively small surveys. Census data have the required sample size but generally do not have the required information. This article uses the case of Ecuador to demonstrate how sample survey data can be combined with census data to yield predicted poverty rates for the population covered by the census. These poverty rates are found to be precisely measured, even at fairly disaggregated levels. However, beyond a certain level of spatial disaggregation, standard errors rise rapidly.},

abstract = {Spatial statistics is a growing discipline providing important analytical techniques in a wide range of disciplines in the natural and social sciences. In the R package GWmodel, we introduce techniques from a particular branch of spatial statistics, termed geographically weighted (GW) models. GW models suit situations when data are not described well by some global model, but where there are spatial regions where a suitably localised calibration provides a better description. The approach uses a moving window weighting technique, where localised models are found at target locations. Outputs are mapped to provide a useful exploratory tool into the nature of the data spatial heterogeneity. GWmodel includes: GW summary statistics, GW principal components analysis, GW regression, GW regression with a local ridge compensation, and GW regression for prediction; some of which are provided in basic and robust forms.},

abstract = {Detailed meteorological measurements were carried out in two urban street canyons in central Adelaide and at two reference sites in a suburban location and at an exposed site near the middle of the city for an extended period of nearly a year. The meteorological records revealed substantial differences between air temperature in the urban street canyons and both reference sites. The nocturnal urban heat island observed in most cities was noted in Adelaide street canyons, too. However, the frequent occurrence of a daytime cool island during summer, albeit much weaker than the night-time phenomenon, is less expected. Both phenomena are attributed at least in part to the increase in surface area participating in energy exchanges with the atmosphere in an urban street canyon compared to a typical rural site, and hence in an increase in the effective thermal mass. The presence of additional thermal mass is manifested not only in the dampening of the diurnal temperature range in the city, but also in a noticeable time lag in the maximum intensity of the daytime cool island. The measurements also demonstrate an observable difference in the daily progression of air temperature between a north-south street canyon and an adjacent east-west oriented street.

abstract = {In this study, local government digital spatial data are used to describe urban geometry and analyse spatial variations of the urban climate within the central areas of G{\"{o}}teborg, Sweden. A high-resolution raster digital elevation model (1 m pixel resolution) consisting of building structures and ground heights is derived from a local government geo-database, as well as land use patterns and artificial heat sources. Parameters such as the sky view factor (SVF) and daily averages of solar radiation are calculated. Results obtained from the model are compared with intra-urban air temperature variations which are derived from mobile measurements, as well as surface temperature variations derived from thermal infrared images. Results show that high-resolution digital elevation models in raster format are very useful sources of data for the investigation of intra-urban temperature variations. Results also show that the areal mean of SVF correlates with intra-urban air temperature variations to a higher degree than SVF that is taken from a point source location. The correlation between the modelled SVF and surface temperature is high during both spring and winter. Adding information about daily averages of global radiation for the spring measurement causes the correlation between SVF and surface temperature variations to increase.

abstract = {A detailed urban surface exchange parameterization, implemented in a meso-scale atmospheric model, has been used to study the urban heat island (UHI) intensity during a summer period in the city of Basel, Switzerland. In this urban parameterization, the city is represented as a combination of three urban classes (road, roof and wall), characterized by the size of the street canyon and the building and is thus able to take into account the momentum sink over the entire height of the building, as well as the shadowing and the radiation trapping effects. A control experiment including all the urban parameters describing the city centre of Basel produced a canyon air temperature that compared well with observations. A series of experiments was then conducted in which successively each of the urban parameters characterizing the city centre was changed providing the basis for an assessment of its effect on UHI mitigation.

@article{Roth2000,
abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive, critical review of turbulence observations over cities. More than fifty studies are analysed with their experimental conditions summarized in an appendix. The main results are based on 14 high-quality experiments which met criteria based on stringent experimental requirements. The observations are presented as non-dimensional statistics to facilitate comparison between urban studies and work conducted over other rough, inhomogeneous surfaces. Wake production associated with bluff bodies, and the inhomogeneous distribution of sources and sinks of scalars, result in a roughness sub-layer which for the studies reviewed extends to about 2.5 to 3 times the height of the buildings. It is shown that within this region the basis of several traditional micrometeorological approaches to describe the turbulent exchange is in doubt. There are strong similarities to flow over plant canopies, and many of the turbulence characteristics can be interpreted in the framework of a plane mixing layer. Future field observations should concentrate on the turbulent exchange near the top and within the urban canopy as well as within the urban boundary layer.},

abstract = {Using a spatial econometric perspective, the speed of convergence for a sample of 163 regions of the European Union (EU) over the period 1981-1996 is estimated. For this purpose, we use a specification strategy which allows an explicit modeling of both spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation found in the analyzed sample. The estimated final model combines groupwise heterocedasticity, the identification of two spatial regimes and spatial dependence. Our results show how an appropriate consideration of the role of spatial effects can shed new insights into the European convergence process. We find that regions in the EU cohesion-fund countries (Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain) are converging separately from the rest of regions of the EU. Our estimations indicate that over the analyzed period, there was a faster conditional convergence in relative income levels of the regions belonging to Cohesion countries (5.3{\%}) than in the rest of the regions of the EU (3.3{\%}). Therefore, our results contrast with other evidence that points to the fact that the convergence process in Europe has weakened or even has stopped at the beginning of the 1980s. Moreover, our work shows clear evidence of separate spatial convergence clubs among EU regions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We review the usefulness of urban spatial economic models of land use change for the study and policy analysis of spatial land use–environment interactions. We find that meaningful progress has been made in econometric and monocentric models extended to account for multiple sources of spatial heterogeneity and in the development of general equilibrium models with spatial dynamics. Despite these advances, more work is needed in developing models with greater realism. Most agent-based computational models of urban land use change currently lack economic fundamentals, but provide a flexible means of linking microlevel behavior and interactions with macrolevel land use dynamics. In combination with empirical methods to identify parameters, this framework provides a promising approach to modeling spatial land use dynamics and policy effects. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

@article{Berrigan2002,
abstract = {Background: Physical inactivity is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes. Results from the transportation literature suggest that aspects of the urban environment may influence walking for transportation. In this paper we examine the association between a proxy measure of the urban environment and walking behavior.

Methods: We analyzed the association between home age and walking behavior in U.S. adults using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals and to control for the effects of gender, race/ethnicity, age, education level, household income, and activity limitations.

Results: Adults who lived in homes built before 1946 and from 1946 to 1973 were significantly more likely to walk 1+ miles ≥20 times per month than those who lived in homes built after 1973. This association was present among people living in urban and suburban counties, but absent among those living in rural counties. The association was also found in models that controlled for gender, race/ethnicity, age, education, income, and any health-related activity limitation. Other forms of leisure-time physical activity were not independently associated with home age.

Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that environmental variables influence walking frequency and suggest that home age may be a useful proxy for features of the urban environment that influence physical activity in the form of walking. Such proxy measures could facilitate testing ecologic models of health behavior using survey data.},

Using these data, we measure segregation of groups within the country. To overcome the endogeneity problem that arises because of mobility and endogenous internal borders, we construct an instrument for segregation. We find that more ethnically and linguistically segregated countries, i.e., those where groups live more spatially separately, have a lower quality of government; there is no relationship between religious segregation and governance. Trust is an important channel of influence; it is lower in more segregated countries.},

Some firms would not be in business without the subsidy. Cost savings due to declining average costs are always greater than the losses incurred where price equals marginal cost. Moreover, it is theoretically possible for inframarginal subsidies to expand output more than equivalent fully coupled subsidies. Empirical analysis of U.S. dairy subsidies isolates these components of cross-subsidization and finds distortions from inframarginal support to be substantial, with implications for trade negotiations, dispute settlement, and policy formulation.},

abstract = {A Bayesian probit model with individual effects that exhibit spatial dependencies is set forth. Since probit models are often used to explain variation in individual choices, these models may well exhibit spatial interaction effects due to the varying spatial location of the decision makers. That is, individuals located at similar points in space may tend to exhibit similar choice behavior. The model proposed here allows for a parameter vector of spatial interaction effects that takes the form of a spatial autoregression. This model extends the class of Bayesian spatial logit/probit models presented in LeSage (2000) and relies on a hierachical construct that we estimate via Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We illustrate the model by applying it to the 1996 presidential election results for 3,110 U.S. counties. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Our new tests may be viewed as computationally simple and robust alternatives to some existing procedures in spatial econometrics. We provide empirical illustrations to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed tests. The finite sample size and power performance of the tests are also investigated through a Monte Carlo study. The results indicate that the adjusted LM tests have good finite sample properties. In addition, they prove to be more suitable for the identification of the source of dependence (lag or error) than their unadjusted counterparts.},

abstract = {While the relationship between urban form and travel behavior is a key element of many current planning initiatives aimed at reducing car travel, the literature faces two major problems. First, this relationship is extremely complex. Second, several specification and estimation issues are poorly addressed in prior work, possibly generating biased results.

We argue that many of the latter problems are overcome by systematically isolating the separable influences of urban design characteristics on travel and then properly analyzing individual-level data. We further clarify which results directly follow from alternative land use arrangements and which may or may not, and thus identify the specific hypotheses to be tested against the data. We then develop more-reliable tests of these hypotheses, and explore the implications of alternative behavioral assumptions regarding travel costs. The measured influence of land use on travel behavior is shown to be very sensitive to the form of the empirical strategy.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the world oil industry since the relevant markets are global. Mergers and acquisitions (M{\&}As) in the petroleum industry reflect the accelerating rate of M{\&}A activity worldwide. The basic change forces are: technological advances, globalization, deregulation, industry dynamics, pressure for economies, and favorable economic environments. The change forces have blurred the boundaries of industries and have multiplied the forms and sources of competition. M{\&}As and restructuring have had positive influences in the performance of the economy. Since the 1980s, real GDP growth in the U.S. has been strong with only short interruptions. During the past 2 decades, almost 2 million new jobs per year have been created. Patterns in the oil industry have mirrored these changes in the economy as a whole, emphasizing technological improvements and cost reductions. Instabilities of prices and other increased risks in the oil industry have triggered M{\&}As and restructuring. Financial analysis of the BP acquisition of Amoco demonstrates that even if a fraction of the estimated cost savings are achieved, market values will be increased. If five major mergers are completed, the HHI for the world oil industry will rise from a very low 389 to 581, still well below the 1,000 critical level specified by the regulatory authorities. Analysis suggests that the BP Amoco acquisition will have positive economic effects on the economy of Alaska.},

@article{Chervachidze2013,
abstract = {In this paper we revisit the many studies that have attempted to explain the determinants of commercial real estate capitalization rates. We introduce two new innovations. First we are able to incorporate two macroeconomic factors that greatly impact cap rates besides treasury rates and local market fundamentals – the variables most commonly used in such research. These are the general corporate risk premium operating in the economy, and the growth rate of debt relative to GDP in the general economy (liquidity). The addition of these factors greatly adds to the ability of previous models to explain the secular fall of cap rates in the last decade and their recent rise – in terms of traditional measures of within-sample fit. Our second innovation is methodological; our analysis uses a large and robust quarterly panel data set of over 30 US metropolitan areas from 1980q1 through 2009q3. With this data we compare 3 models: a “base model” and then one that selectively adds each of our macro-economic variables. We test the ability of each of these models to fit the 2002–2009 period using “back test” dynamic forecasts. Our conclusion is that much of the secular decline in cap rates from 2000 through 2007 and their subsequent rise seem attributable to the macro-economic factors and less to movements in market fundamentals.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Pasqualetti2004,
abstract = {The article discusses how humans have always found ways to use wind power as a vital energy source. The wind helped humans explore the world; they had no other energy source. It continues to help us prepare foods and pump water. In some places, the wind is such a part of daily life that in its absence, silence blankets the landscape and puts us out of sorts. Putting the wind to work was our first conscious use of solar power. Perhaps the most widespread use of wind machines, at least in the United States, has been to pump water. Dotting the Great Plains by the hundreds of thousands, farm windmills--along with grain silos--were once as characteristic of the landscape as coal spoils were of Appalachia. Today, wind machines receive substantial notoriety and publicity, plus a controversial mix of support and resistance. Instead of a stream of water, modern wind machines are pumping a stream of electrons, a product proving to be a valuable asset to farmers who are trying to address present day economic realities of living off the land. The new appearance and mechanics of wind machines reflects their different role. Instead of producing mechanical power for the purposes of pumping and grinding, the new machines convert mechanical energy into electricity. Wind power's popularity is widespread and growing, a result of its increasing profitability and the perceived environmental benefits it engenders. It also results from the simple fact that, unlike fossil and nuclear fuels, wind is a widely available, familiar element of the environment. The first step is seemingly the easiest: finding it. Among other states attracting interest, Texas has been the pacesetter with more than {\$}1 billion in new wind investment and 1,293 MW installed, mostly in the western part of the state near such communities as Big Springs and McCamey. Construction of a typical 100 MW wind farm produces more than 50,000 days (approximately 419,020 manhours) of employment.

@article{Collier2006,
abstract = {The industrial revolution led to a rapid development of urban areas. This has continued unremittingly over the last 200 years or so. In most urban areas the surface properties are heterogeneous, which has significant implications for energy budgets, water budgets and weather phenomena within the part of the earth's atmosphere that humans live. In this paper I discuss the structure of the planetary boundary layer, confining our analysis to the region above the rooftops (canopy layer) up to around the level where clouds form. It is in this part of the atmosphere that most of the weather impacting our lives occurs, and where the buildings of our cities impact the weather.In this review, observations of the structure of the urban atmospheric boundary layer are discussed. In particular the use of Doppler lidar provides measurements above the canopy layer. The impact of high-rise buildings is considered.Urban morphology impacts energy fluxes and airflow leading to phenomena such as the urban heat island and convective rainfall initiation. I discuss in situ surface-based remote sensing and satellite measurements of these effects. Measurements have been used with simple and complex numerical models to understand the complexity and balance of the interactions involved. Cities have been found to be sometimes up to 10 degC warmer than the surrounding rural areas, and to cause large increases in rainfall amounts. However, there are situations in which urban aerosol may suppress precipitation.Although much progress has been made in understanding these impacts, our knowledge remains incomplete. These limitations are identified. As city living becomes even more the norm for large numbers of people, it is imperative that we ensure that urban effects on the weather are included in development plans for the built environment of the future.

@article{Albert1993,
abstract = {A vast literature in statistics, biometrics, and econometrics is concerned with the analysis of binary and polychotomous response data. The classical approach fits a categorical response regression model using maximum likelihood, and inferences about the model are based on the associated asymptotic theory. The accuracy of classical confidence statements is questionable for small sample sizes. In this article, exact Bayesian methods for modeling categorical response data are developed using the idea of data augmentation. The general approach can be summarized as follows. The probit regression model for binary outcomes is seen to have an underlying normal regression structure on latent continuous data. Values of the latent data can be simulated from suitable truncated normal distributions. If the latent data are known, then the posterior distribution of the parameters can be computed using standard results for normal linear models. Draws from this posterior are used to sample new latent data, and the process is iterated with Gibbs sampling. This data augmentation approach provides a general framework for analyzing binary regression models. It leads to the same simplification achieved earlier for censored regression models. Under the proposed framework, the class of probit regression models can be enlarged by using mixtures of normal distributions to model the latent data. In this normal mixture class, one can investigate the sensitivity of the parameter estimates to the choice of "link function," which relates the linear regression estimate to the fitted probabilities. In addition, this approach allows one to easily fit Bayesian hierarchical models. One specific model considered here reflects the belief that the vector of regression coefficients lies on a smaller dimension linear subspace. The methods can also be generalized to multinomial response models with {\$}J > 2{\$} categories. In the ordered multinomial model, the J categories are ordered and a model is written linking the cumulative response probabilities with the linear regression structure. In the unordered multinomial model, the latent variables have a multivariate normal distribution with unknown variance-covariance matrix. For both multinomial models, the data augmentation method combined with Gibbs sampling is outlined. This approach is especially attractive for the multivariate probit model, where calculating the likelihood can be difficult.},

abstract = {The new urbanism argues that land-use planning should be used to create higher-density development and to promote alternatives to the use of personal automobiles for transportation. The concerns of the new urbanist movement are shown to be misplaced, and the goals of the new urbanism are shown to be in conflict with market incentives, making them difficult to implement in any event. A better policy for more efficient land use would be for governments to plan more effectively for their own infrastructure development while allowing the development of privately-owned land to be guided by market forces.},

@article{Harman2006,
abstract = {A model is developed for the energy balance of an urban area, represented as a sequence of two-dimensional street canyons. The model incorporates a novel formulation for the sensible-heat flux, that has previously been validated against wind tunnel models, and a formulation for radiation that includes multiple reflections and shadowing. This energy balance model is coupled to a model for the atmospheric boundary layer. Results are analysed to establish how the physical processes combine to produce the observed features of urban climate, and to establish the roles of building form and fabric on the urban modification to climate.Over a diurnal cycle there are morning and evening transition periods when the net flux of radiation is largely balanced by the flux of heat into the surface. The urban surface has a large surface area in contact with the air, and hence a large active heat capacity, and so the urban area needs to absorb a larger amount of heat than a rural area to change the surface temperature. The morning and evening transitions are therefore prolonged over urban areas, delaying the onset of convective or stable boundary layers after sunrise and sunset. The model shows that the energy balance of the roof behaves very differently from the combined energy balance of the street canyon system of walls and street. The sensible-heat flux from the street canyon into the boundary layer is increased by the increased surface area, but is decreased by the buildings reducing the local flow speeds. The net result is that, for the two-dimensional geometry investigated here, the sensible-heat flux from the canyon is not strongly sensitive to canyon geometry. The sensible-heat flux from the roof is larger than from the street, and so the total sensible-heat flux into the boundary layer, and hence also the air temperature, is strongly dependent on the fraction of plan area occupied by roofs. The radiation budget of the street canyon, which largely drives the temperatures of the canyon surfaces, is significantly changed by the limited sky view and multiple reflections caused by the local building form. The canyon surface temperatures thus depend strongly on local building morphology.Finally, two mechanisms are suggested for how urban areas might maintain a positive sensible-heat flux at night. Firstly, if the roof material has much lower heat capacity than the street canyon surfaces, then the roof can cool the boundary-layer air faster than the street canyon surfaces cool, leading to a positive heat flux out of the street canyon. Secondly, advection decouples the boundary layer from the local surface energy balance. In this way, cool air, perhaps from a rural area, advected on to an urban surface can lead to a positive sensible-heat flux which then tends to neutralize any stable stratification in the boundary layer.

For the daily series, random thermometer precision and screen errors are the second largest source of uncertainty. Annual CETs are least uncertain, whereas daily CETs are most uncertain. Despite the uncertainties in annual mean CET, the trend of 0.077 °C per decade since 1900 is significant at the 1{\%} level.In an additional investigation, we detect biases in the published series of central England maximum and minimum temperatures, and implement systematic adjustments of up to ±0.2 °C to the values up to 1921 and up to ±0.1 °C to the values since 1980. These adjustments are of opposite sign in maximum and minimum temperature, so they do not affect mean CET, but they improve the homogeneity of the diurnal temperature range, which then shows little trend before 1980 and a reduced rising trend thereafter. The uncertainties in maximum and minimum temperature make the data inadequate for the task of establishing the magnitude of the recent increase of diurnal range. © Crown Copyright 2005.

abstract = {To obtain a local-scale urban energy balance by either measurement or modeling it is necessary to determine storage heat flux ([Delta]Qs). This flux cannot be measured directly due to the complexity of the urban surface. The Grimmond et al. Objective Hysteresis Model (OHM) [C.S.B. Grimmond, H.A. Cleugh, T.R. Oke, An objective urban heat storage model and its comparison with other schemes, Atmos. Environ., 25B (1991) 311-326] of local-scale [Delta]Qs combines empirical equations for individual surface types in the proportion that they are present within the urban area. One surface type for which there is very limited field data is the urban canyon, which consists of the walls of adjacent buildings, the horizontal street-level area separating them (roadways, gardens, parking lots, etc.) and the enclosed air volume. Here the storage heat flux of an urban canyon and the resulting OHM parameters are investigated with a numerical model of a dry urban canyon energy budget. Substrate heat fluxes are derived from simulated surface and substrate temperatures; the latter evolve through time according to the finite difference form of the Fourier heat conduction equation. When compared against measured fluxes, the model performed satisfactorily. Numerical experiments show significant effects on the OHM parameters due to changes in the ratio of building height to separation distance and building wall thermal properties. Effects of intermediate significance were attributable to canyon orientation, wind speed and the timing of the between-building air temperature regime. Air temperature and the timing of the wind speed curve showed only minor significance.},

abstract = {Abstract: The transportation sector offers substantial potential for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission abatement, but widely divergent cost estimates complicate policy making; energy–economy policy modelers apply top-down and bottom-up cost definitions and different assumptions about future technologies and the preferences of firms and households. Our hybrid energy–economy policy model is technology-rich, like a bottom-up model, but has empirically estimated behavioral parameters for risk and technology preferences, like a top-down model. Unlike typical top-down models, however, it simulates technological change endogenously with functions that relate the financial costs of technologies to cumulative production and adjust technology preferences as market shares change. We apply it to the choice of personal vehicles to indicate, first, the effect on cost estimates of divergent cost definitions and, second, the possible response to policies that require a minimum market share for low emission vehicles.

abstract = {Environmental determinants of health are receiving growing attention in the literature, although there is little empirical research in this area. The Study on Environmental and Individual Determinants of Physical Activity (known as the SEID project) was a social ecological project that examined the relative influence of individual, social environmental and physical environmental determinants of recreational physical activity. It involved a community survey of 1803 healthy workers and home-makers aged 18–59 years living in a 408{\&}{\#}xa0;km2 area of metropolitan Perth, Western Australia. Physical environmental determinants were mainly conceptualised as spatial access to popular recreational facilities. Overall, 59{\%} of respondents exercised as recommended. Recreational facilities located near home were used by more respondents than facilities located elsewhere. The most frequently used facilities were informal: the streets (45.6{\%}); public open space (28.8{\%}) and the beach (22.7{\%}). The physical environment's directs the influence on exercising as recommended was found to be secondary to individual and social environmental determinants. Nevertheless, accessible facilities determined whether or not they were used and in this way, support and enhance the achievement of recommended levels of physical activity behaviour by providing opportunities. The results suggest that access to a supportive physical environment is necessary, but may be insufficient to increase recommended levels of physical activity in the community. Complementary strategies are required that aim to influence individual and social environmental factors. Given the popularity of walking in the community, it is recommended that greater emphasis be placed on creating streetscapes that enhance walking for recreation and transport.},

abstract = {While the relationship between urban form and travel behavior is a key element of many current planning initiatives aimed at reducing car travel, the literature faces two major problems. First, this relationship is extremely complex. Second, several specification and estimation issues are poorly addressed in prior work, possibly generating biased results.

We argue that many of the latter problems are overcome by systematically isolating the separable influences of urban design characteristics on travel and then properly analyzing individual-level data. We further clarify which results directly follow from alternative land use arrangements and which may or may not, and thus identify the specific hypotheses to be tested against the data. We then develop more-reliable tests of these hypotheses, and explore the implications of alternative behavioral assumptions regarding travel costs. The measured influence of land use on travel behavior is shown to be very sensitive to the form of the empirical strategy.},

abstract = {Spatial econometrics has been criticized by some economists because some model specifications have been driven by data-analytic considerations rather than having a firm foundation in economic theory. In particular this applies to the so-called W matrix, which is integral to the structure of endogenous and exogenous spatial lags, and to spatial error processes, and which are almost the sine qua non of spatial econometrics. Moreover it has been suggested that the significance of a spatially lagged dependent variable involving W may be misleading, since it may be simply picking up the effects of omitted spatially dependent variables, incorrectly suggesting the existence of a spillover mechanism. In this paper we review the theoretical and empirical rationale for network dependence and spatial externalities as embodied in spatially lagged variables, arguing that failing to acknowledge their presence at least leads to biased inference, can be a cause of inconsistent estimation, and leads to an incorrect understanding of true causal processes.},

@article{Parker2005,
abstract = {We assess the random and systematic uncertainties affecting the central England temperature (CET) record since 1878 on daily, monthly and annual time scales. The largest contribution to uncertainty in CET on all these time scales arises from areal sampling, followed for annual and monthly CET by thermometer calibration. For the daily series, random thermometer precision and screen errors are the second largest source of uncertainty. Annual CETs are least uncertain, whereas daily CETs are most uncertain. Despite the uncertainties in annual mean CET, the trend of 0.077 °C per decade since 1900 is significant at the 1{\%} level.In an additional investigation, we detect biases in the published series of central England maximum and minimum temperatures, and implement systematic adjustments of up to ±0.2 °C to the values up to 1921 and up to ±0.1 °C to the values since 1980. These adjustments are of opposite sign in maximum and minimum temperature, so they do not affect mean CET, but they improve the homogeneity of the diurnal temperature range, which then shows little trend before 1980 and a reduced rising trend thereafter. The uncertainties in maximum and minimum temperature make the data inadequate for the task of establishing the magnitude of the recent increase of diurnal range. © Crown Copyright 2005.

Key aspects of marketing applications include the discreteness of response or outcome data and relatively large numbers of cross-sectional units, each with possibly low information content. The use of informative priors including hierarchical models is essential for successful Bayesian applications in marketing. Given the importance of the prior, it is important to assure flexibility in the prior specification. Non-standard likelihoods and flexible priors make marketing a very challenging area for Bayesian applications.},

@article{Crane1998,
abstract = {Can urban design improve the environment? If communities could be designed to reduce automobile use, then yes. But can urban design influence travel? Surprisingly perhaps, the effects of any specific neighborhood feature on travel behavior at the margin are all but unknown. The policy significance of this issue is reflected in the swelling popularity of the ‘new urbanism’ and other planning strategies employing land use tools to mitigate the environmental impacts of metropolitan development. In addition to asserting that development patterns and densities affect how far, how often, and by what means people travel, urban designers frequently argue that the legibility and shape of the local street pattern play a key role. ‘Connected’ residential blocks are thus associated with less driving by comparison with the circuitous routes of the modern suburban cul-de-sac—chiefly by reducing trip lengths and facilitating pedestrian and transit access. Remarkably, there is little empirical and theoretical support for these claims. This paper provides the first direct tests of these hypotheses within a consistent behavioral framework. An analysis of household travel diary and GIS data for San Diego finds little role for land use in explaining travel behavior, and no evidence that the street network pattern affects either short or long non-work travel decisions. While results may vary in other areas, the empirical argument for using land use as an element of regional air quality or other environmental plans remains to be demonstrated.},

The estimation of the appropriate spatial regimes spatial error model shows that the convergence process is different across regimes. The authors also estimate a strongly significant spatial spillover effect: the average growth rate of per capita GDP of a given region is positively affected by the average growth rate of neighboring regions.},

It serves as the introduction to a collection of new papers on spatial econometric data analysis brought together in this special issue, dealing specifically with new extensions to the spatial econometric modeling perspective. Although the initial development of the field of spatial econometrics has been rather slow, the Dixit-Stiglitz revolution and the emergence of the New Economy Geography have been instrumental in uplifting the significance and the use of spatial data analysis techniques. Concurrent developments in other social sciences parallel this situation in economics. The upsurge in spatial econometrics is, among other things, driven by the recognition that traditional spatial econometric models are insufficient to capture modern theoretical developments. Therefore, this issue brings together a collection of articles on space-time and discrete choice modeling, spatial nonstationarity, and the methodology and empirics of regional economic growth models.},

Once the model has been introduced it is used to generate synthetic data, using R code, and these generated data are then used to estimate its parameters. This sequence confirms understanding of both the model and the R routine for fitting it to the data. Finally, the model is applied to an analysis of a historical data set. By using R, the whole procedure can be reproduced by the reader. All the data sets used in the book are available on the website The book is written for undergraduate students of mathematics, economics, business and finance, geography, engineering and related disciplines, and postgraduate students who may need to analyze time series as part of their taught program or their research.},

@article{Harris1989,
abstract = {During the late 1970s, U.S. house prices were appreciating rapidly even though mortgage interest rates were climbing. Recently, interest rates have eased but prices have moderated. This study examines the role of appreciation expectations in overcoming the negative effects of nominal mortgage interest rates on house prices. Expectations of future appreciation are important determinants of house sales prices, remaining influential during periods of declining and moderating real prices, not just when prices are rising. The real rate of interest, as viewed by the homebuyer, is the mechanism for affecting change in housing price levels. Because the nominal interest rate is slow to reflect changes in expectations, these real rates vary over time. This ebb and flow of real interest rates appears to explain market price levels. Nominal rates play a role as well, primarily in the formation of appreciation expectations. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

@article{Gaigne2012,
abstract = {There is a wide consensus among international institutions and national governments in favor of compact (i.e. densely populated) cities as a way to improve the ecological performance of the transport system. Indeed, when both the intercity and intra-urban distributions of activities are given, a higher population density makes cities more environmentally friendly because the average commuting length is reduced. However, when we account for the possible relocation of activities within and between cities in response to a higher population density, the latter may cease to hold. Indeed, an increasing-density policy affects prices, wages and land rents, which in turn incentivizes firms and households to change place. This reshapes the urban system in a way that may generate a higher level of pollution. Thus, although an increase in compactness is environmentally desirable when locations are given, compactness may not be environmentally-friendly when one accounts for the general equilibrium effects generated by such a policy. },

@article{Crane1998,
abstract = {Can urban design improve the environment? If communities could be designed to reduce automobile use, then yes. But can urban design influence travel? Surprisingly perhaps, the effects of any specific neighborhood feature on travel behavior at the margin are all but unknown. The policy significance of this issue is reflected in the swelling popularity of the ‘new urbanism’ and other planning strategies employing land use tools to mitigate the environmental impacts of metropolitan development. In addition to asserting that development patterns and densities affect how far, how often, and by what means people travel, urban designers frequently argue that the legibility and shape of the local street pattern play a key role. ‘Connected’ residential blocks are thus associated with less driving by comparison with the circuitous routes of the modern suburban cul-de-sac—chiefly by reducing trip lengths and facilitating pedestrian and transit access. Remarkably, there is little empirical and theoretical support for these claims. This paper provides the first direct tests of these hypotheses within a consistent behavioral framework. An analysis of household travel diary and GIS data for San Diego finds little role for land use in explaining travel behavior, and no evidence that the street network pattern affects either short or long non-work travel decisions. While results may vary in other areas, the empirical argument for using land use as an element of regional air quality or other environmental plans remains to be demonstrated.},

abstract = {Since the first statement of Hicks's induced innovation hypothesis in 1932, a large number of theoretical and empirical studies have analyzed the issue of price-induced technological change—many of them on the basis of substitution elasticities. This note compares technologies across space and time on the basis of factual and counterfactual substitution elasticities and argues that differences in estimated substitution elasticities should be decomposed into two counterfactual components. The first component is designed to indicate how the ease of substitution is altered by varied economic circumstances; the second addresses the question of how technologies would compare under genuinely comparable situations. This argument is illustrated by the example of energy-price elasticities of capital before and after the oil crisis of the early 1970s.},

@article{Moller2006,
abstract = {After more than 25 years of continuous development, Danish wind-energy landscapes are due for face changes. On-shore construction has ceased and necessary re-powering schemes have not been introduced as yet. Regional planning is discouraging, while conditions for erecting new turbines have become more stringent. One of the factors inhibiting development seems to be uncertainty in planning about the future impact on landscapes. Visual impact has rarely been an issue so far, but ever-increasing turbine size and less local involvement may change this. This paper presents a deterministic approach of determining the likely visual-impact on landscapes and population, taking into account that there is no clear threshold for perceived adverse visual-impact. A geographical information system (GIS) has been used to build a regional landscape model for Northern Jutland County, which is used to assess visibility of turbines in the period of 1990 to 2010, based on historical and planning data. Multiple viewsheds are calculated for various thresholds of visual impact and overlaid with population and land-use data. The results show that a decrease in the number of turbines by about 40{\%} and an increase in installed capacity of 20{\%} will not add to the comparative impact in general. However, the pattern of visibility will become askew, and the present homogenous distribution of visibility will fade. This, together with changing ownership and receding local involvement, could ultimately lead to a decline in the popular acceptance of wind power.},

@article{Davis2008,
abstract = {Despite the extensive literature on prediction of banking crises by Early Warning Systems (EWSs), their practical use by policy makers is limited, even in the international financial institutions. This is a paradox since the changing nature of banking risks as more economies liberalise and develop their financial systems, as well as ongoing innovation, makes the use of EWS for informing policies aimed at preventing crises more necessary than ever. In this context, we assess the logit and signal extraction EWS for banking crises on a comprehensive common dataset. We suggest that logit is the most appropriate approach for global EWS and signal extraction for country-specific EWS. Furthermore, it is important to consider the policy maker's objectives when designing predictive models and setting related thresholds since there is a sharp trade-off between correctly calling crises and false alarms. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We show that U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol can be rationalized under political economy considerations. The reason is that U.S. compliance costs exceed low willingness to pay for dealing with global warming in the U.S. The withdrawal had a crucial impact on the implementation design of the protocol prior to its likely ratification. The remaining non-EU Parties to the Kyoto Protocol gained veto bargaining power and, thus, were successful in asserting far-reaching concessions from the EU on sink credits and, in particular, on the tradability of emission rights. Taking these concessions into account, the Kyoto Protocol was essentially reduced to a symbolic treaty that codifies more or less business-as-usual emissions and makes compliance a rather cheap deal.},

This has not been the case, however,with newermethods of spatial analysis in particular, spatial statistics. Only recently has this situation started to change. This paper documents the confluence of spatial statistics and urban analysis by first reviewing developments in spatial statistics, and then presenting examples of recent applications in urban analysis. The developments reviewed fall under the rubric of global and local forms of spatial analysis, and cover three major technical issues: spatial association, spatial heterogeneity and the modifiable areal unit problem. The examples highlight the relevance and usefulness of the techniques reviewed for urban transportation and land-use applications. The paper concludes with conjectures concerning future developments at the intersection of spatial statistics and urban analysis.},

@article{Nakata2004,
abstract = {The current century—an era of environmental awareness—requires energy resources to satisfy the world's future energy demands. We can use current energy use scenarios to help us to understand how energy systems could change. Such scenarios are not an exercise in prophecy; rather they are designed to challenge our thinking in order to make better decisions today. The conventional modeling approach tends to extrapolate changes in energy consumption from historical trends; however, technology innovation sometimes causes drastic reforms in energy systems in the industrial, commercial, residential and transportation sectors. The economic aspects are another key issue to be considered in order to understand future changes in energy systems. The quantity of the energy supply is set to meet the price of the energy demand of end users. This occurs on the condition that the price of the energy supply equates with the price on the demand side under the market mechanism. This paper reviews the various issues associated with the energy-economic model and its application to national energy policies, renewable energy systems, and the global environment.

Assessment tools for urban climate are very important to understand effective countermeasures for heat-island mitigation. In this paper, various assessment tools are introduced and classified according to corresponding modelling scales. Special attention is given to the recent progress in Japan. It is shown that these assessment tools are very powerful at estimating the effectiveness of countermeasures. Furthermore, these assessment tools should become design tools for practical applications in the future. Copyright © 2007 Royal Meteorological Society},

In the case of spatial dependence, following theoretical arguments from new economic geography, and endogenous growth models, this phenomenon has been associated with the existence of externalities that cross regional borders. However, despite the general consensus that interactions or externalities are likely to be the major source of spatial dependence, they have been modelled in a rather ad hoc manner in most existing empirical studies. In contrast, we advocate basing the analysis on structural growth models which include externalities across economies, applying the appropriate spatial econometrics tools to test for their presence and estimate the magnitude of these externalities in the real world.},

@article{Gunning2000,
abstract = {This paper argues that contrary to Roy Cordato's claim, Ronald Coase's work on the “problem of social cost” is an important contribution to Austrian economics. Coase identified a criterion that can be used to establish initial legal rights to control actions that have external effects. In other words, he discovered a criterion that, in some cases, can be directly applied to help establish a property system when there is none. The criterion also helps a government adapt, or maintain, a property system in light of continuing changes that are characteristic of the entrepreneur economy. Cordato's anti-state ethical economics, which he used to criticize Coase, is a deviation from the century-old tradition of Austrian economics. Menger, Mises and Hayek saw economics as a body of logical knowledge that is value free. In addition they recognized a role for government in defining legal rights and in maintaining the property system in light of changing conditions. Accordingly, it is wrong to invoke “Austrian economics,” properly understood, to criticize this aspect of Coase's work. In this paper, I argue that Cordato has followed a deviant and troubling path by trying to construct an Austrian economics based on ethics, that he has failed to understand that a changeable property system is a prerequisite for the market economy, and that he has correspondingly failed to recognize Coase's contribution to the problem of how to maintain the property system in light of continuing change.},

@article{Collier2006,
abstract = {The industrial revolution led to a rapid development of urban areas. This has continued unremittingly over the last 200 years or so. In most urban areas the surface properties are heterogeneous, which has significant implications for energy budgets, water budgets and weather phenomena within the part of the earth's atmosphere that humans live. In this paper I discuss the structure of the planetary boundary layer, confining our analysis to the region above the rooftops (canopy layer) up to around the level where clouds form. It is in this part of the atmosphere that most of the weather impacting our lives occurs, and where the buildings of our cities impact the weather.In this review, observations of the structure of the urban atmospheric boundary layer are discussed. In particular the use of Doppler lidar provides measurements above the canopy layer. The impact of high-rise buildings is considered.Urban morphology impacts energy fluxes and airflow leading to phenomena such as the urban heat island and convective rainfall initiation. I discuss in situ surface-based remote sensing and satellite measurements of these effects. Measurements have been used with simple and complex numerical models to understand the complexity and balance of the interactions involved. Cities have been found to be sometimes up to 10 degC warmer than the surrounding rural areas, and to cause large increases in rainfall amounts. However, there are situations in which urban aerosol may suppress precipitation.Although much progress has been made in understanding these impacts, our knowledge remains incomplete. These limitations are identified. As city living becomes even more the norm for large numbers of people, it is imperative that we ensure that urban effects on the weather are included in development plans for the built environment of the future.

Entrepreneurship may thus be more attractive in areas featuring high employment risk and/or low returns. This research contributes to the existing regional employment portfolio literature by using more disaggregated data at both the county and the commuting zone levels. Commuting zones in particular represent a broader spectrum of labor market agglomerations across both rural and urban areas to provide the most stringent and revealing tests of the interrelationship between local employment portfolios and the choice to pursue entrepreneurship. The authors find a U-shaped risk/return trade-off using employment variance and growth, consistent with the literature. They test their hypothesis with a model of regional entrepreneurship, incorporating the employment portfolio variables. This is the first known study to explore the hypothesized relationship between wage and salary employment portfolios and entrepreneurship, effectively synthesizing two previously disparate literatures. © The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {There is growing concern about the negative environmental and energy effects caused by transportation systems and related land-use patterns. Travel and land-use are a function of one another, therefore it is often hypothesized that changing urban structure can result in changes in energy consumption. A popular view suggests that there is a strong negative correlation between urban density and energy consumption. This implies that increasing density will result in a reduction in energy consumption [Cities and Automobile Dependence: An International Sourcebook, Avebury Technical, Great Britain, 1989].

Using Co-Plot, an innovative multivariate statistical technique, this research crystallizes some of the relationships between density and energy consumption in western cities. The method is applied on Newman and Kenworthy’s data, leading to the conclusion that there is no direct impact of total urban density. Instead several other relationships between energy consumption and density attributes can be identified.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose simple diagnostic tests, based on ordinary least-squares (OLS) residuals, for spatial error autocorrelation in the presence of a spatially lagged dependent variable and for spatial lag dependence in the presence of spatial error autocorrelation, applying the modified Lagrange multiplier (LM) test developed by Bera and Yoon (Econometric Theory, 1993, 9, 649-658). Our new tests may be viewed as computationally simple and robust alternatives to some existing procedures in spatial econometrics. We provide empirical illustrations to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed tests. The finite sample size and power performance of the tests are also investigated through a Monte Carlo study. The results indicate that the adjusted LM tests have good finite sample properties. In addition, they prove to be more suitable for the identification of the source of dependence (lag or error) than their unadjusted counterparts.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a dynamic risk-based model capable of jointly explaining the term structure of interest rates, returns on the aggregate market and the risk and return characteristics of value and growth stocks. Both the term structure of interest rates and returns on value and growth stocks convey information about how the representative investor values cash flows of different maturities. We model how the representative investor perceives risks of these cash flows by specifying a parsimonious stochastic discount factor for the economy. Shocks to dividend growth, the real interest rate, and expected inflation are priced, but shocks to the price of risk are not. Given reasonable assumptions for dividends and inflation, we show that the model can simultaneously account for the behavior of aggregate stock returns, an upward-sloping yield curve, the failure of the expectations hypothesis and the poor performance of the capital asset pricing model.},

abstract = {The present Spanish laws on the procedure to evaluate the environmental impact of wind farms are ambiguous, especially those pertaining to visual impact. There is no specific national law but only regional laws. The main targets of these laws are the conservation of the environment (protected animals and plants), and the noise generated. The focus of this paper, the visual impact, is not taken into account in a direct way in these laws.
This work develops a methodology to predict, before its construction, the visual impact that a wind farm can have. This could be used as a consulting tool to analyze and evaluate wind projects, both government-run and private.
The developed methodology is quick, concise and clear.},

abstract = {The voucher scheme introduced in Chile in 1981 allows for-profit private subsidized schools to choose their students. The objective of this article is to present evidence of this practice and examine its relationship with academic performance using information from the 2005 SIMCE test, in which parents were asked about the admission requirements for their children's schools. We present evidence indicating that student selection is a widespread practice among private subsidized schools. Using OLS and after controlling for a series of selection criteria and the segmentation effects that they produce, the evidence indicates that there are no differences in results between public and private subsidized education. Our results show that a student attending a school that uses selection criteria obtains 7-9 percent higher results in standardized mathematics tests than a student from a school that does not use selection. The main conclusion of this study is that the basic belief behind the voucher system in Chile that competition will lead to better quality of all schools is not being met. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Our method allows computationally fast estimation of term structure models with a large number of pricing factors. We present specification tests favoring a model using five principal components of yields as factors. We demonstrate that this model outperforms the Cochrane and Piazzesi (2008) four-factor specification in out-of-sample exercises but generates similar in-sample term premium dynamics. Our regression approach can also incorporate unspanned factors and allows estimation of term structure models without observing a zero-coupon yield curve. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Surface evaporation is an important component of the urban energy balance, and its role in arid-zone cities may significantly differ from that observed in more temperate regions. However, the quantification of evapotranspiration is difficult in a complex urban setting, given the heterogeneity of the terrain and its various dry and wet elements. Here an open-air scaled urban surface (OASUS) is employed to quantify latent heat flux as a function of the surface area available for evaporation and the three-dimensional (3-D) urban geometry. The OASUS model consists of an extensive urban-like building/street array located in an arid Negev region of southern Israel (30.8°N, 480 m above sea level). Measurements were carried out during the summer month of August, and flux partitioning was analysed using evaporation pans of varying surface areas embedded in arrays of varying height. Results indicated that the increase in latent heat removal with respect to equivalent lsquovegetativersquo surface area was nearly linear. Increasing latent heat flux with lsquovegetated fractionrsquo was offset in approximately equal measure by decreases in storage and turbulent sensible heat flux. The proportion of the radiant energy budget represented by evaporative heat loss was also linked to the 3-D geometry of the array, increasing linearly with the ratio between vegetative cover and the lsquocompletersquo urban surface area.

Hierarchical zoning, unlike mutually exclusive zoning, is uni-directional in that it protects upper-level residential uses from nonconforming, non-residential uses but not vice versa. The result is that the lower-level zones can be a mixture of several nonconforming, incompatible uses. This unique attribute of hierarchical zoning offers a window of opportunity for choices for affordable housing at affordable locations. Using hedonic analysis, empirical evidence shows that huge price discounts (over 15{\%}) are associated with apartments that are situated in nonconforming zones. Arguments here support more flexible zoning.},

@article{Frankel2012,
abstract = {We investigate whether leading indicators can help explain the cross-country incidence of the 2008-09 financial crisis. Rather than looking for indicators with specific relevance to the recent crisis, the selection of variables is driven by an extensive review of more than eighty papers from the previous literature on early warning indicators. Our motivation is to address suspicions that indicators found to be useful predictors in one round of crises are typically not useful to predict the next round. The review suggests that central bank reserves and past movements in the real exchange rate were the two leading indicators that had proven the most useful in explaining crisis incidence across different countries and episodes in the past. For the 2008-09 crisis, we use six different variables to measure crisis incidence: drops in GDP and industrial production, currency depreciation, stock market performance, reserve losses, and participation in an IMF program. We find that the level of reserves in 2007 appears as a consistent and statistically significant leading indicator of who got hit by the 2008-09 crisis, in line with the conclusions of the pre-2008 literature. In addition to reserves, recent real appreciation is a statistically significant predictor of devaluation and of a measure of exchange market pressure during the current crisis. We define the period of the global financial shock as running from late 2008 to early 2009, which probably explains why we find stronger results than earlier papers such as Obstfeld et al. (2009, 2010) and Rose and Spiegel (2009a,b, 2010, 2011) which use annual data. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Growth management attempts to improve the ordering of development to improve outcomes. To taxpayers, growth management promises more efficient delivery of public facilities and services. To developers, growth management promises more certainty. To citizen activists, growth management promises resolution of development problems in advance, instead of on an ad hoc basis. These promises are heroic. Nonetheless, even if only partly successful, communities engaged in growth management should out-perform other communities in overall economic output. This paper evaluates the economic performance of 182 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with 1990 populations between 100,000 and 500,000 over the period 1972 to 1992 with respect to presence or absence of growth management efforts such as urban growth boundaries, urban service limits, and state or regional oversight of local planning. We find a positive association between the presence of growth management and economic performance; communities engaged in growth management realized marginal improvements in economic performance relative to other communities, ceteris parnbus.},

abstract = {A general theory of cross-subsidization due to inframarginal support is developed. Two sources of output distortion are identified: exit deterrence and extramarginal output. Some firms would not be in business without the subsidy. Cost savings due to declining average costs are always greater than the losses incurred where price equals marginal cost. Moreover, it is theoretically possible for inframarginal subsidies to expand output more than equivalent fully coupled subsidies. Empirical analysis of U.S. dairy subsidies isolates these components of cross-subsidization and finds distortions from inframarginal support to be substantial, with implications for trade negotiations, dispute settlement, and policy formulation.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze the financial turmoil of the US subprime loan crisis of mid-Noughties and to compare it with the Japanese asset bubble of late 1980s. While examining the two crises, it compares the monetary policies of both countries, focusing on the excess liquidity and expansion of bank loans that were seen. This paper develops several bubble indicators, including the ratio of real estate loans to total loans, the loan-to-GDP ratio, and housing affordability. In order to develop these indicators, it is necessary to compare banking behavior in both Japan and the United States, as banks in both countries were making loans beyond the point of profit maximization. Property prices and monetary policy in both countries influenced banking behavior significantly.

@article{Hughes2006,
abstract = {ing the sensitivity of gasoline demand to changes in prices and income has important implications for policies related to climate change, optimal taxation and national security, to name only a few. While the short-run price and income elasticities of gasoline demand in the United States have been studied extensively, the vast majority of these studies focus on consumer behavior in the 1970s and 1980s. There are a number of reasons to believe that current demand elasticities differ from these previous periods, as transportation analysts have hypothesized that behavioral and structural factors over the past several decades have changed the responsiveness of U.S. consumers to changes in gasoline prices. In this paper, we compare the price and income elasticities of gasoline demand in two periods of similarly high prices from 1975 to 1980 and 2001 to 2006. The short-run price elasticities differ considerably and range from -0.034 to -0.077 during 2001 to 2006, versus -0.21 to -0.34 for 1975 to 1980. The estimated short-run income elasticities range from 0.21 to 0.75 and when estimated with the same models are not significantly different between the two periods. One implication of these findings is that gasoline taxes would need to be significantly larger today in order to achieve an equivalent reduction in gasoline consumption. This, coupled with the political difficulties in adopting gasoline taxes, suggests that policies and technologies designed to improve fuel economy are likely becoming relatively more attractive as a means to reduce fuel consumption.},

abstract = {The transportation sector needs to reduce fuel consumption to deal with global warming because it depends on fossil fuels strongly and it seems to be difficult to substitute other fuels. This study aims at investigating an optimal land use in urban areas from the viewpoint of reducing energy consumption for transportation. For this purpose, the authors developed two kinds of models. One minimizes the total trip length under the condition of constant congestion. The other minimizes the fuel consumption directly where congestion is taken into account endogenously. The optimal structures calculated numerically illustrate that business areas are located around the center of a city while residential areas are on the suburbs, which is similar to the actual land use observed generally. These results are compared with the land use of the central business district (CBD) in Tokyo.},

abstract = {A detailed urban surface exchange parameterization, implemented in a meso-scale atmospheric model, has been used to study the urban heat island (UHI) intensity during a summer period in the city of Basel, Switzerland. In this urban parameterization, the city is represented as a combination of three urban classes (road, roof and wall), characterized by the size of the street canyon and the building and is thus able to take into account the momentum sink over the entire height of the building, as well as the shadowing and the radiation trapping effects. A control experiment including all the urban parameters describing the city centre of Basel produced a canyon air temperature that compared well with observations. A series of experiments was then conducted in which successively each of the urban parameters characterizing the city centre was changed providing the basis for an assessment of its effect on UHI mitigation.

@article{Gunning2000,
abstract = {This paper argues that contrary to Roy Cordato's claim, Ronald Coase's work on the “problem of social cost” is an important contribution to Austrian economics. Coase identified a criterion that can be used to establish initial legal rights to control actions that have external effects. In other words, he discovered a criterion that, in some cases, can be directly applied to help establish a property system when there is none. The criterion also helps a government adapt, or maintain, a property system in light of continuing changes that are characteristic of the entrepreneur economy. Cordato's anti-state ethical economics, which he used to criticize Coase, is a deviation from the century-old tradition of Austrian economics. Menger, Mises and Hayek saw economics as a body of logical knowledge that is value free. In addition they recognized a role for government in defining legal rights and in maintaining the property system in light of changing conditions. Accordingly, it is wrong to invoke “Austrian economics,” properly understood, to criticize this aspect of Coase's work. In this paper, I argue that Cordato has followed a deviant and troubling path by trying to construct an Austrian economics based on ethics, that he has failed to understand that a changeable property system is a prerequisite for the market economy, and that he has correspondingly failed to recognize Coase's contribution to the problem of how to maintain the property system in light of continuing change.},

As predicted, the leaders were more assertive in managing subordinate-subordinate conflicts. Unexpectedly, they also pressed their own subordinates quite forcefully in the subordinate-outsider disputes. The second study investigated subordinates' interventions in their leaders' disputes. In these conflicts, subordinates adopted a low-key shuttle diplomacy; meeting separately with the parties, listening to their opinions, transmitting these to the other side, and calling for each side's empathy and understanding.},

abstract = {In this paper, I give a personal view on the development of the field of spatial econometrics during the past 30 years. I argue that it has moved from the margins to the mainstream of applied econometrics and social science methodology. I distinguish three broad phases in the development, which I refer to as preconditions, take off and maturity. For each of these phases I describe the main methodological focus and list major contributions. I conclude with some speculations about future directions. Resumen En este art{\'{\i}}culo, expongo mi opini{\'{o}}n personal sobre el avance en el campo de la econometr{\'{\i}}a espacial durante los {\'{u}}ltimos 30 a{\~{n}}os. Mi argumento es que ha pasado de estar en la periferia de la econometr{\'{\i}}a espacial y la metodolog{\'{\i}}a de ciencias sociales a ser algo corriente. Hago la distinci{\'{o}}n entre tres fases principales en el avance, a las que denomino precondiciones, arranque y madurez. Para cada una de estas fases describo el objetivo metodol{\'{o}}gico principal y proporciono un listado con las contribuciones principales. Concluyo con especulaciones sobre posibles direcciones en el futuro.},

@article{Lee2013,
abstract = {Conditional autoregressive models are commonly used to represent spatial autocorre- lation in data relating to a set of non-overlapping areal units, which arise in a wide variety of applications including agriculture, education, epidemiology and image analysis. Such models are typically specified in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, with inference based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. The most widely used software to fit such models is WinBUGS or OpenBUGS, but in this paper we introduce the R pack- age CARBayes. The main advantage of CARBayes compared with the BUGS software is its ease of use, because: (1) the spatial adjacency information is easy to specify as a binary neighbourhood matrix; and (2) given the neighbourhood matrix the models can be implemented by a single function call in R. This paper outlines the general class of Bayesian hierarchical models that can be implemented in the CARBayes software, de- scribes their implementation via MCMC simulation techniques, and illustrates their use with two worked examples in the fields of house price analysis and disease mapping.},

abstract = {Spatstat is a package for analyzing spatial point pattern data. Its functionality includes exploratory data analysis, model-fitting, and simulation. It is designed to handle realistic datasets, including inhomogeneous point patterns, spatial sampling regions of arbitrary shape, extra covariate data, and marks attached to the points of the point pattern. A unique feature of spatstat is its generic algorithm for fitting point process models to point pattern data. The interface to this algorithm is a function ppm that is strongly analogous to lm and glm. This paper is a general description of spatstat and an introduction for new users.},

Hierarchical zoning, unlike mutually exclusive zoning, is uni-directional in that it protects upper-level residential uses from nonconforming, non-residential uses but not vice versa. The result is that the lower-level zones can be a mixture of several nonconforming, incompatible uses. This unique attribute of hierarchical zoning offers a window of opportunity for choices for affordable housing at affordable locations. Using hedonic analysis, empirical evidence shows that huge price discounts (over 15{\%}) are associated with apartments that are situated in nonconforming zones. Arguments here support more flexible zoning.},

@article{RobertJ.FranzeseJr2010,
abstract = {atiotemporal interdependence - i.e., that the outcomes, actions, or choices of some unit-times depend on those of others - is substantively and theoretically ubiquitous and central in binary outcomes of interest across the social sciences. However, most empirical applications omit spatial interdependence and, at best, treat temporal dependence as nuisance to be “kludged”; indeed, even theoretical and substantive discussion usually ignores (inter)dependence. Moreover, in the few contexts where spatial interdependence has been acknowledged or emphasized, such as in the social-network and policy-diffusion literatures, empirical models either do not fully reflect the simultaneity of the outcomes across units, or they do not recognize the endogeneity of the spatial lags which are used (appropriately) to model the interdependence. This paper notes and explains some of the severe challenges posed by spatiotemporal interdependence in binary-outcome models and then follows recent spatial-econometric advances to suggest two simulation-based approaches for surmounting the computational intensiveness of these models: classical recursive-importance-sampling (RIS) or Bayesian Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Serial autocorrelation in binary outcomes raises essentially the same challenges, so these strategies offer effective approach to temporal dependence as well. We provide Monte-Carlo comparisons of the performance of these alternative estimators for spatial probit, including comparisons to estimation-strategies blind to or na{\"{\i}}ve about (inter)dependence - i.e., omitting spatial lags or including them but treating them as exogenous regressors in standard probit estimation - and then we show how to apply related simulation methods to calculate estimated spatial effects of hypothetical shocks in terms of outcomes or probabilities of outcomes (with associated confidence/credibility regions) rather than only in parameter-estimate or latent-variable terms as in all prior spatial-probit applications. We illustrate with applications to U.S. states’ adoptions of legislative term-limits and to great-power decisions to enter World War I.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine the association between sense of community, walking, and neighborhood design characteristics. The current study is based on a sub-sample of participants (n=609) from the US Atlanta SMARTRAQ study who completed a telephone survey capturing physical activity patterns, neighborhood perceptions, and social interactions. Objective measures of neighborhood form were also computed. Univariate and multivariate models (General Linear Models (GLM)) were used to examine the association between sense of community (SofC) and aspects of the built environment, physical activity, and neighborhood perceptions. In multivariate models the impact on SofC was examined with progressive adjustment for demographics characteristics followed by walking behavior, neighborhood design features, neighborhood perceptions and time spent traveling in a car. After adjustment, SofC was positively associated with leisurely walking (days/week), home ownership, seeing neighbors when walking and the presence of interesting sites. SofC was also associated with higher commercial floor space to land area ratios (FAR) - a proxy for walkable site design that captures the degree to which retail destinations are set back from the street, the amount of surface parking, and urban design of an area. Conversely the presence of more mixed use and perceptions of steep hills were inversely associated with SofC. SofC is enhanced by living in areas that encourage leisurely walking, hence it is associated with living in neighbourhoods with lower levels of land use mix, but higher levels of commercial FAR. Our results suggest that in terms of SofC, the presence of commercial destinations may inhibit social interaction among local residents unless urban design is used to create convivial pedestrian-friendly commercial areas, e.g., providing street frontage, rather than flat surface parking. This finding has policy implications and warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {This paper develops a new early warning system (EWS) model, based on a multinomial logit model, for predicting financial crises. It is shown that commonly used EWS approaches, which use binomial discrete-dependent-variable models, are subject to what we call a post-crisis bias. This bias arises when no distinction is made between tranquil periods, when economic fundamentals are largely sound and sustainable, and crisis/post-crisis periods, when economic variables go through an adjustment process before reaching a more sustainable level or growth path. We show that applying a multinomial logit model, which allows distinguishing between more than two states, is a valid way of solving this problem and constitutes a substantial improvement in the ability to forecast financial crises. The empirical results reveal that, for a set of 20 open emerging markets for the period 1993-2001, the model would have correctly predicted a large majority of crises in emerging markets. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This tutorial is an introduction to spatial data in R and map making with R's `base' graphics and the popular graphics package ggplot2. It assumes no prior knowledge of spatial data analysis but prior understanding of the R command line would be beneficial. For people new to R, we recommend working through an `Introduction to R' type tutorial, such as "A (very) short introduction to R" (Torfs and Brauer, 2012) or the more geographically inclined "Short introduction to R" (Harris, 2012). Building on such background material, the following set of exercises is concerned with specific functions for spatial data and visualisation. It is divided into five parts: *Introduction, which provides a guide to R's syntax and preparing for the tutorial *Spatial data in R, which describes basic spatial functions in R *Manipulating spatial data, which includes changing projection, clipping and spatial joins *Map making with ggplot2, a recent graphics package for producing beautiful maps quickly *Taking spatial analysis in R further, a compilation of resources for furthering your skills An up-to-date version of this tutorial is maintained at https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R and the entire tutorial, including the input data can be downloaded as a zip file, as described below. The entire tutorialwas written in RMarkdown, which allows R code to run as the document compiles. Thus all the examples are entirely reproducible. Suggested improvements welcome - please fork, improve and push this document to its original home to ensure its longevity. The tutorial was developed for a series of Short Courses put on by the National Centre for Research Methods, via the TALISMAN node (see geotalisman.org).},

abstract = {This research looks at the impact of high-voltage transmission lines (HVTL) on surrounding property values, using a microspatial approach. It is based on a sample of 507 single-family houses sold over the 1991-96 period in the City of Brossard, in the Greater Montreal area, Canada. Findings suggest that although severe visual encumbrance due to a direct view on a pylon or conductors does exert a significantly negative impact on property prices with depreciations ranging from 5{\%} to well in excess of 20{\%}, being adjacent to the easement will not necessarily cause a house to depreciate and may even increase its value in similar proportions where proximity advantages exceed drawbacks.

@article{LeSage1999,
abstract = {This text provides an introduction to spatial econometric theory along with numerous applied illustrations of the models and methods described. The applications utilize a set of MATLAB functions that implement a host of spatial econometric estimation methods. The intended audience is faculty,studen ts and practitioners involved in modeling spatial data sets. The MATLAB functions described in this book have been used in my own research as well as teaching both undergraduate and graduate econometrics courses. They are available on the Internet at http://www.econ.utoledo.edu along with the data sets and examples from the text. The theory and applied illustrations of conventional spatial econometric models represent about half of the content in this text,with the other half devoted to Bayesian alternatives. Conventional maximum likelihood estimation for a class of spatial econometric models is discussed in one chapter,follo wed by a chapter that introduces a Bayesian approach for this same set of models. It is well-known that Bayesian methods implemented with a diffuse prior simply reproduce maximum likelihood results,and we illustrate this point. However, the main motivation for introducing Bayesian methods is to extend the conventional models. Comparative illustrations demonstrate how Bayesian methods can solve problems that confront the conventional models. Recent advances in Bayesian estimation that rely on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods make it easy to estimate these models. This approach to estimation has been implemented in the spatial econometric function library described in the text, so estimation using the Bayesian models require a single additional line in your computer program. Some of the Bayesian methods have been introduced in the regional science literature,or presented at conferences. Space and time constraints prohibit any discussion of implementation details in these forums. This text describes the implementation details,whic h I believe greatly enhance understanding and allow users to make intelligent use of these methods in applied settings. Audiences have been amazed (and perhaps skeptical) when I tell them it takes only 10 seconds to generate a sample of 1,000 MCMC draws from a sequence of conditional distributions needed to estimate the Bayesian models. Implementation approaches that achieve this type of speed are described here in the hope that other researchers can apply these ideas in their own work. I have often been asked about Monte Carlo evidence for Bayesian spatial econometric methods. Large and small sample properties of estimation procedures are frequentist notions that make no sense in a Bayesian setting. The best support for the efficacy of Bayesian methods is their ability to provide solutions to applied problems. Hopefully,the ease of using these methods will encourage readers to experiment with these methods and compare the Bayesian results to those from more conventional estimation methods. Implementation details are also provided for maximum likelihood methods that draw on the sparse matrix functionality of MATLAB and produce rapid solutions to large applied problems with a minimum of computer memory. I believe the MATLAB functions for maximum likelihood estimation of conventional models presented here represent fast and efficient routines that are easier to use than any available alternatives. Talking to colleagues at conferences has convinced me that a simple software interface is needed so practitioners can estimate and compare a host of alternative spatial econometric model specifications. An example in Chapter 5 produces estimates for ten different spatial autoregressive models,including maximum likelihood,robust Bayesian,and a robust Bayesian tobit model. Estimation, prin ting and plotting of results for all these models is accomplished with a 39 line program. Many researchers ignore sample truncation or limited dependent variables because they face problems adapting existing spatial econometric software to these types of sample data. This text describes the theory behind robust Bayesian logit/probit and tobit versions of spatial autoregressive models and geographically weighted regression models. It also provides implementation details and software functions to estimate these models. Toolboxes are the name given by the MathWorks to related sets of MATLAB functions aimed at solving a particular class of problems. Toolboxes of functions useful in signal and a host of other areas are available from the MathWorks as add-ons to the standard MATLAB software distribution. I use the term Econometrics Toolbox to refer to my public domain collection of function libraries available at the internet address given above. The MATLAB spatial econometrics functions used to implement the spatial econometric models discussed in this text rely on many of the functions in the Econometrics Toolbox. The spatial econometric functions constitute a library within the broader set of econometric functions. To use the spatial econometrics function library you need to download and install the entire set of Econometrics Toolbox functions. The spatial econometrics function library is part of the Econometrics Toolbox and will be available for use along with more traditional econometrics functions. The collection of around 500 econometrics functions and demonstration programs are organized into libraries, with approximately 40 spatial econometrics library functions described in this text. A manual is available for the Econometrics Toolbox in Acrobat PDF and postscript on the internet site,but this text should provide all the information needed to use the spatial econometrics library. A consistent design was implemented that provides documentation,example programs,and functions to produce printed as well as graphical presentation of estimation results for all of the econometric and spatial econometric functions. This was accomplished using the structure variables introduced in MATLAB Version 5. Information from estimation procedures is encapsulated into a single variable that contains fields for individual parameters and statistics related to the econometric results. A thoughtful design by the MathWorks allows these structure variables to contain scalar,v ector,matrix,string,and even multidimensional matrices as fields. This allows the econometric functions to return a single structure that contains all estimation results. These structures can be passed to other functions that intelligently decipher the information and provide a printed or graphical presentation of the results. The Econometrics Toolbox along with the spatial econometrics library functions should allow faculty to use MATLAB in undergraduate and graduate level courses with absolutely no programming on the part of students or faculty. Practitioners should be able to apply the methods described in this text to problems involving large spatial data samples using an input program with less than 50 lines. Researchers should be able to modify or extend the existing functions in the spatial econometrics library. They can also draw on the utility routines and other econometric functions in the Econometrics Toolbox to implement and test new spatial econometric approaches. I have returned from conferences and implemented methods from papers that were presented in an hour or two by drawing on the resources of the Econometrics Toolbox. This text has another goal,applied modeling strategies and data analysis. Given the ability to easily implement a host of alternative models and produce estimates rapidly,atten tion naturally turns to which models best summarize a particular spatial data sample. Much of the discussion in this text involves these issues. My experience has been that researchers tend to specialize,one group is devoted to developing new econometric procedures,and another group focuses on applied problems that involve using existing methods. This text should have something to offer both groups. If those developing new spatial econometric procedures are serious about their methods,they should take the time to craft a generally useful MATLAB function that others can use in applied research. The spatial econometrics function library provides an illustration of this approach and can be easily extended to include new functions. It would also be helpful if users who produce generally useful functions that extend the spatial econometrics library would submit them for inclusion. This would have the added benefit of introducing these new research methods to faculty and their students. There are obviously omissions,bugs and perhaps programming errors in the Econometrics Toolbox and the spatial econometrics library functions. This would likely be the case with any such endeavor. I would be grateful if users would notify me via e-mail at they encounter problems. The toolbox is constantly undergoing revision and new functions are being added. If youre using these functions,up date to the latest version every few months and youll enjoy speed improvements along with the benefits of new methods. Instructions for downloading and installing these functions are in an Appendix to this text along with a listing of the functions in the library and a brief description of each. Numerous people have helped in my spatial econometric research efforts and the production of this text. John Geweke explained the mysteries of MCMC estimation when I was a visiting scholar at the Minneapolis FED. He shared his FORTRAN code and examples without which MCMC estimation might still be a mystery. Luc Anselin with his encylopedic knowledge of the field was kind enough to point out errors in my early work on MCMC estimation of the Bayesian models and set me on the right track. He has always been encouraging and quick to point out that he explored Bayesian spatial econometric m},

abstract = {Structured additive regression (STAR) models provide a flexible framework for modeling possible nonlinear effects of covariates: They contain the well established frameworks of generalized linear models (GLM) and generalized additive models (GAM) as special cases but also allow a wider class of effects, e.g., for geographical or spatio-temporal data, allowing for specification of complex and realistic models. BayesX is standalone software package providing software for fitting general class of STAR models. Based on a comprehensive open-source regression toolbox written in C++, BayesX uses Bayesian inference for estimating STAR models based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation techniques, a mixed model representation of STAR models, or stepwise regression techniques combining penalized least squares estimation with model selection. BayesX not only covers models for responses from univariate exponential families, but also models from less-standard regression situations such as models for multi-categorical responses with either ordered or unordered categories, continuous time survival data, or continuous time multi-state models. This paper presents a new fully interactive R interface to BayesX: the R package R2BayesX. With the new package, STAR models can be conveniently specified using R's formula language (with some extended terms), fitted using the BayesX binary, represented in R with objects of suitable classes, and finally printed/summarized/plotted. This makes BayesX much more accessible to users familiar with R and adds extensive graphics capabilities for visualizing fitted STAR models. Furthermore, R2BayesX complements the already impressive capabilities for semiparametric regression in R by a comprehensive toolbox comprising in particular more complex response types and alternative inferential procedures such as simulation-based Bayesian inference.},

Yet locating electrical generating windmills has become difficult in some localities because of potential negative externalities. We address why the NIMBY syndrome may arise when choosing site locations by addressing the perceived property rights of a viewshed, the role of compensation in a NIMBY impasse, and how concerns for the environment might lessen the compensation required. We use a willingness to accept framework to measure the compensation required to allow wind generation windmills to be built in the mountains of North Carolina. We find that individuals who perceive wind energy as a clean source of power require less compensation. Those who retire to the mountains or individuals who have ancestors from Watauga County require more compensation to accept windmills in their viewshed. In addition, we find in a bivariate-probit analysis that individuals who are more likely to participate in a green energy program are also more likely to allow electrical generation windmills in their viewshed, suggesting that the green vs. green environmental debate is overstated.},

@article{Harman2006,
abstract = {A model is developed for the energy balance of an urban area, represented as a sequence of two-dimensional street canyons. The model incorporates a novel formulation for the sensible-heat flux, that has previously been validated against wind tunnel models, and a formulation for radiation that includes multiple reflections and shadowing. This energy balance model is coupled to a model for the atmospheric boundary layer. Results are analysed to establish how the physical processes combine to produce the observed features of urban climate, and to establish the roles of building form and fabric on the urban modification to climate.Over a diurnal cycle there are morning and evening transition periods when the net flux of radiation is largely balanced by the flux of heat into the surface. The urban surface has a large surface area in contact with the air, and hence a large active heat capacity, and so the urban area needs to absorb a larger amount of heat than a rural area to change the surface temperature. The morning and evening transitions are therefore prolonged over urban areas, delaying the onset of convective or stable boundary layers after sunrise and sunset. The model shows that the energy balance of the roof behaves very differently from the combined energy balance of the street canyon system of walls and street. The sensible-heat flux from the street canyon into the boundary layer is increased by the increased surface area, but is decreased by the buildings reducing the local flow speeds. The net result is that, for the two-dimensional geometry investigated here, the sensible-heat flux from the canyon is not strongly sensitive to canyon geometry. The sensible-heat flux from the roof is larger than from the street, and so the total sensible-heat flux into the boundary layer, and hence also the air temperature, is strongly dependent on the fraction of plan area occupied by roofs. The radiation budget of the street canyon, which largely drives the temperatures of the canyon surfaces, is significantly changed by the limited sky view and multiple reflections caused by the local building form. The canyon surface temperatures thus depend strongly on local building morphology.Finally, two mechanisms are suggested for how urban areas might maintain a positive sensible-heat flux at night. Firstly, if the roof material has much lower heat capacity than the street canyon surfaces, then the roof can cool the boundary-layer air faster than the street canyon surfaces cool, leading to a positive heat flux out of the street canyon. Secondly, advection decouples the boundary layer from the local surface energy balance. In this way, cool air, perhaps from a rural area, advected on to an urban surface can lead to a positive sensible-heat flux which then tends to neutralize any stable stratification in the boundary layer.

Each recalled the most recent dispute they had encountered either between two subordinates or between a subordinate and a person outside the group (i.e., an outsider).Subsequently, they reported the techniques used to mange the dispute. As predicted, the leaders were more assertive in managing subordinate-subordinate conflicts. Unexpectedly, they also pressed their own subordinates quite forcefully in the subordinate-outsider disputes. The second study investigated subordinates' interventions in their leaders' disputes. In these conflicts, subordinates adopted a low-key shuttle diplomacy; meeting separately with the parties, listening to their opinions, transmitting these to the other side, and calling for each side's empathy and understanding.},

Findings suggest that although severe visual encumbrance due to a direct view on a pylon or conductors does exert a significantly negative impact on property prices with depreciations ranging from 5{\%} to well in excess of 20{\%}, being adjacent to the easement will not necessarily cause a house to depreciate and may even increase its value in similar proportions where proximity advantages exceed drawbacks.

abstract = {Microclimate formation and its significance in urban planning was examined through two components that predominate in affecting the city's climate: built-up morphology and urban shade trees.The methodological approach focus is on a generalization procedure for quantifying the thermal effect of any studied situation through parameterization of the vegetated variables and the built-up forms. The analysis is integrative, using empirical climatic data followed by an analytical study for generalization and sensitivity analysis using an integrative model, the Green CTTC model.Three urban tree species predominant in the Tel Aviv gardens and streets, with different canopy characteristics, and three levels of building densities were analysed to determine their thermal effect on an urban street microclimate. The variables were parameterized according to six basic cooling attributes for the studied tree species in urban gardens in Tel Aviv, and according to three geometric built-up parameters for the studied urban street.The integrative modelling approach of considering all changes simultaneously was illustrated on an urban boulevard in Tel Aviv. The analysis demonstrates the shortcomings of piecemeal modelling and the merits of the integrative approach.The study indicates the importance of urban trees in alleviating the heat island effect in a hot and humid summer. The tree cooling effect was found to be strongly related to the built form geometry. In all the studied cases, the thermal effect of the tree was found to depend mainly on its canopy coverage level and planting density in the urban street and little on other species characteristics.The methodology of analysis presented in this paper can be applied to develop an operational tool in assessing for an urban open space the integrative thermal effects of different tree species, and of the varied urban morphology and the interaction between them.

abstract = {There is a wide consensus among international institutions and national governments in favor of compact (i.e. densely populated) cities as a way to improve the ecological performance of the transport system. Indeed, when both the intercity and intra-urban distributions of activities are given, a higher population density makes cities more environmentally friendly because the average commuting length is reduced. However, when we account for the possible relocation of activities within and between cities in response to a higher population density, the latter may cease to hold. Indeed, an increasing-density policy affects prices, wages and land rents, which in turn incentivizes firms and households to change place. This reshapes the urban system in a way that may generate a higher level of pollution. Thus, although an increase in compactness is environmentally desirable when locations are given, compactness may not be environmentally-friendly when one accounts for the general equilibrium effects generated by such a policy. },

abstract = {It is widely recognised that public acceptability often poses a barrier towards renewable energy development. This article reviews existing research on public perceptions of wind energy, where opposition is typically characterized by the NIMBY (not in my back yard) concept. The objectives of the article are to provide a critical assessment of past research and an integrated, multidimensional framework to guide future work. Six distinct strands of research are identified, summarized and critiqued: public support for switching from conventional energy sources to wind energy; aspects of turbines associated with negative perceptions; the impact of physical proximity to turbines; acceptance over time of wind farms; NIMBYism as an explanation for negative perceptions; and, finally, the impact of local involvement on perceptions. Research across these strands is characterized by opinion poll studies of general beliefs and case studies of perceptions of specific developments. In both cases, research is fragmented and has failed to adequately explain, rather than merely describe, perceptual processes. The article argues for more theoretically informed empirical research, grounded in social science concepts and methods. A multidimensional framework is proposed that goes beyond the NIMBY label and integrates previous findings with social and environmental psychological theory.

abstract = {We consider the efficiency implications of policies to reduce global carbon emissions in a world with pre-existing tax distortions. We first note that the weak double dividend, the proposition that the welfare improvement from a tax reform where environmental taxes are used to lower distorting taxes must be greater than the welfare improvement from a reform where the environmental taxes are returned in a lump sum fashion, need not hold in a world with multiple distortions. We then present a large-scale computable general equilibrium model of the world economy with distortionary taxation. We use this model to evaluate a number of policies to reduce carbon emissions. We find that the weak double dividend is not obtained in a number of European countries. Results also demonstrate the point that the interplay between carbon policies and pre-existing taxes can differ markedly across countries. Thus, one must be cautious in extrapolating the results from a country specific analysis to other countries.},

While it is worthwhile to understand the properties of economic equilibrium, equilibrium concepts have dominated economic thought to the point that they have obscured some of the more important issues economists have always strived to understand. At least since Adam Smith’s time, economists have tried to understand the causes of prosperity, and how economic welfare can be enhanced, but these issues are best understood outside the equilibrium framework. The foundations provided by the Austrian school point toward ways that economic analysis can expand beyond the equilibrium framework.},

In the R package GWmodel, we introduce techniques from a particular branch of spatial statistics, termed geographically weighted (GW) models. GW models suit situations when data are not described well by some global model, but where there are spatial regions where a suitably localised calibration provides a better description. The approach uses a moving window weighting technique, where localised models are found at target locations. Outputs are mapped to provide a useful exploratory tool into the nature of the data spatial heterogeneity. GWmodel includes: GW summary statistics, GW principal components analysis, GW regression, GW regression with a local ridge compensation, and GW regression for prediction; some of which are provided in basic and robust forms.},

abstract = {Detailed meteorological measurements were carried out in two urban street canyons in central Adelaide and at two reference sites in a suburban location and at an exposed site near the middle of the city for an extended period of nearly a year. The meteorological records revealed substantial differences between air temperature in the urban street canyons and both reference sites. The nocturnal urban heat island observed in most cities was noted in Adelaide street canyons, too. However, the frequent occurrence of a daytime cool island during summer, albeit much weaker than the night-time phenomenon, is less expected. Both phenomena are attributed at least in part to the increase in surface area participating in energy exchanges with the atmosphere in an urban street canyon compared to a typical rural site, and hence in an increase in the effective thermal mass. The presence of additional thermal mass is manifested not only in the dampening of the diurnal temperature range in the city, but also in a noticeable time lag in the maximum intensity of the daytime cool island. The measurements also demonstrate an observable difference in the daily progression of air temperature between a north-south street canyon and an adjacent east-west oriented street.

@article{Cervero1996a,
abstract = {The New Urbanism movement calls for redesigning American neighborhoods so that they are less oriented toward automobile travel and more conducive to walking, bicycling and transit riding, especially for non-work trips. New Urbanism calls for a return to compact neighborhoods with grid-like street patterns, mixed land uses and pedestrian amenities. This paper investigates the effects of New Urbanism design principles on both non-work and commuting travel by comparing modal splits between two distinctly different neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay Area. The neo-traditional neighborhood, Rockridge, and the nearby conventional suburban community, Lafayette, were chosen as case sites because they have similar income profiles, freeway and transit service levels, and geographical locations. Rockridge residents averaged around a 10 percentage point higher share of non-work trips by non-automobile modes than did residents of Lafayette, controlling for relevant factors like income and transit service levels. The greatest differences were for shop trips under one mile. Rockridge residents also averaged substantially higher rates of non-work walk trips per day, matched by lower rates of daily auto travel, suggesting that walking substitutes for motorized travel, at the margin. Modal splits were more similar for work trips, confirming the proposition that neighborhood design practices exert their greatest influence on local shopping trips and other non-work purposes. For work trips, compact, mixed-use, and pedestrian-oriented development appears to have the strongest effect on access trips to rail stations, in particular inducing higher shares of access trips by foot and bicycle.},

abstract = {This paper challenges an emerging conventional wisdom: that transport energy consumption, and hence pollution, can be substantially reduced by promoting more compact cities. Such reasoning has quickly found its way from academic studies to official policy in many countries. Do the likely savings from such containment warrant the required draconian policies? An empirical assessment of transport energy consumption arising from decentralization is used to address this question. Two contextual reviews - of the compact city case and the strength of decentralization - precede the assessment. The conclusion is that energy savings will be minimal and that other policies might be more fruitful.},

The emphasis is on the relevance of a spatial data analytic perspective and on the operational setting in which this can be implemented. These ideas are part of an overall framework that distinguishes four spatial analysis functions: selection, manipulation, exploration, and confirmation. The relevance of spatial econometrics and spatial statistics for empirical analysis of real estate markets is illustrated with respect to three specific examples: efficient survey design, pattern recognition, and the estimation of hedonic models. Particular attention is paid to the linkages between the spatial data analytic functions and the more traditional GIS analysis functions, both conceptually and in existing software environments.},

The presence of spillover effects is investigated with spatial econometric methods, which assess the impact of the funds on the targeted region and its neighbours. We also control the potential endogeneity problem in the estimation of their impact. Our estimation results indicate that significant convergence takes place, but that the funds have no impact on it. Simulation experiments show how investments targeted to the peripheral regions never spill over to their neighbours, which calls for a reconsideration of current regional policy tools.},

abstract = {Early warning system (EWS) can be treated as a pattern recognition problem since the distinctive feature of economic crisis makes it possible to distinguish critical and normal economic situations using a pattern classifier. Although the most works in EWS are mainly focused on training and pattern classifier, little attention has been paid to the effective indices or feature variables that allow closer look and analysis about the current instability nature of the economic crisis. This paper proposes to utilize market instability index (MII) and stepwise risk warning levels that can diagnose the current instability of the stock market to foretell how the current stock market will proceed in advance. This approach allows the proper policy actions to be taken for the possible financial crisis according to different risk warning levels of instability. Through empirical examples with Korean stock market and Greece stock market, the proposed method demonstrates its potential usefulness in an early warning system. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Staudt2007,
abstract = {Reliable time-series is the basic ingredient when analysing climatic changes. However, the errors in real data are frequently of the same order as the signal being sought. Therefore, the available long-term monthly series of Spanish minimum and maximum temperatures have been compiled from the late 19th century on, in order to compile a high-quality data set. The series are organized into climatically homogeneous regional groups and, in each group, the detection and adjustment is based on relative homogeneity and an analysis of the stationarity of the whole set of temperature-difference series. These series are scanned with moving t, Alexandersson, and Mann-Kendall tests. The detected inhomogeneities are adjusted by weighted averages of the regional series. The method is iterative and advances in steps of detection, adjustment, and actualization. Individual inhomogeneous data are discarded and gaps are filled by similar weighted multiple means.For the analysis of the temperature evolution in the Iberian Peninsula, each region is finally represented by one local series and the regional average. The urban effect on minimum temperatures is adjusted by an empirical method, and for Madrid also by a correction derived from new homogenized data. Generally, rigorous homogeneity cannot be achieved because the initial data quality is deficient in many cases and metadata are sparse. Nevertheless, the data homogeneity and quality has been considerably enhanced: the total error margin in a series is of the order of 0.3 °C-0.4 °C, under consideration of a worst-case error accumulation. On the other hand, the number of inhomogeneities is considerable and their average amplitude is of the order of 1 °C reflecting the much larger error margin in the raw data. The homogenized dataset compiled constitutes an important basis for the subsequent detection of thermal changes in Spain in the last 130 years, on a clearly higher confidence level than before.

@article{Cervero1996a,
abstract = {The New Urbanism movement calls for redesigning American neighborhoods so that they are less oriented toward automobile travel and more conducive to walking, bicycling and transit riding, especially for non-work trips. New Urbanism calls for a return to compact neighborhoods with grid-like street patterns, mixed land uses and pedestrian amenities. This paper investigates the effects of New Urbanism design principles on both non-work and commuting travel by comparing modal splits between two distinctly different neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay Area. The neo-traditional neighborhood, Rockridge, and the nearby conventional suburban community, Lafayette, were chosen as case sites because they have similar income profiles, freeway and transit service levels, and geographical locations. Rockridge residents averaged around a 10 percentage point higher share of non-work trips by non-automobile modes than did residents of Lafayette, controlling for relevant factors like income and transit service levels. The greatest differences were for shop trips under one mile. Rockridge residents also averaged substantially higher rates of non-work walk trips per day, matched by lower rates of daily auto travel, suggesting that walking substitutes for motorized travel, at the margin. Modal splits were more similar for work trips, confirming the proposition that neighborhood design practices exert their greatest influence on local shopping trips and other non-work purposes. For work trips, compact, mixed-use, and pedestrian-oriented development appears to have the strongest effect on access trips to rail stations, in particular inducing higher shares of access trips by foot and bicycle.},

abstract = {Are migration networks associated with lower capital costs, or the alleviation of capital constraints? We examine these questions with data measuring access to remittance flows among small-scale entrepreneurs in Mexico. Using a survey of more than 6000 self-employed workers and small firm owners located in 44 urban areas of Mexico, we estimate the impact of attachment to migration networks on the level of capital investment, the capital-output ratio, sales, and profits of microenterprises. The impact is identified from the geographic pattern of migration from Mexico driven by the completion of rail lines in the early 1900s. For the full sample of firms, we find that migration is associated with higher investment levels and higher profits, but not higher sales. The strongest effects on investment are in the categories of automobiles, tools and inventories. When the sample is limited to firms in high-capital sectors, investment, sales, and profits all increase with attachment to the migration networks, suggesting that attachment to the migration network alleviates capital constraints in those sectors.},

abstract = {In recent years, problems concerning the urban climate-including the urban heat-island effect and urban air pollution - have attracted much attention in terms of the widespread urbanization in many parts of the world, including Japan. Assessment tools for urban climate are very important to understand effective countermeasures for heat-island mitigation. In this paper, various assessment tools are introduced and classified according to corresponding modelling scales. Special attention is given to the recent progress in Japan. It is shown that these assessment tools are very powerful at estimating the effectiveness of countermeasures. Furthermore, these assessment tools should become design tools for practical applications in the future. Copyright © 2007 Royal Meteorological Society},

Many of the factors traditionally mentioned as influencing the term structure are thus included in a way which is fully consistent with maximizing behavior and rational expectations. The model leads to specific formulas for bond prices which are well suited for empirical testing.},

To overcome the endogeneity problem that arises because of mobility and endogenous internal borders, we construct an instrument for segregation. We find that more ethnically and linguistically segregated countries, i.e., those where groups live more spatially separately, have a lower quality of government; there is no relationship between religious segregation and governance. Trust is an important channel of influence; it is lower in more segregated countries.},

We then extend a model typically used to explain risk premia to assess the extent to which credit ratings captured these premia. Next, we estimate a cointegrating relationship between spreads and their long-term fundamental determinants and compare the spreads predicted by this estimated relationship with actual spreads. We find that spreads were significantly below what would be predicted by fundamentals from end-2004 up to the middle of 2005; by contrast, since May 2010, actual spreads have exceeded predicted spreads by some 400 basis points. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Cervero1997,
abstract = {The built environment is thought to influence travel demand along three principal dimensions —density, diversity, and design. This paper tests this proposition by examining how the ‘3Ds’ affect trip rates and mode choice of residents in the San Francisco Bay Area. Using 1990 travel diary data and land-use records obtained from the U.S. census, regional inventories, and field surveys, models are estimated that relate features of the built environment to variations in vehicle miles traveled per household and mode choice, mainly for non-work trips. Factor analysis is used to linearly combine variables into the density and design dimensions of the built environment. The research finds that density, land-use diversity, and pedestrian-oriented designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-auto travel in statistically significant ways, though their influences appear to be fairly marginal. Elasticities between variables and factors that capture the 3Ds and various measures of travel demand are generally in the 0.06 to 0.18 range, expressed in absolute terms. Compact development was found to exert the strongest influence on personal business trips. Within-neighborhood retail shops, on the other hand, were most strongly associated with mode choice for work trips. And while a factor capturing ‘walking quality’ was only moderately related to mode choice for non-work trips, those living in neighborhoods with grid-iron street designs and restricted commercial parking were nonetheless found to average significantly less vehicle miles of travel and rely less on single-occupant vehicles for non-work trips. Overall, this research shows that the elasticities between each dimension of the built environment and travel demand are modest to moderate, though certainly not inconsequential. Thus it supports the contention of new urbanists and others that creating more compact, diverse, and pedestrian-orientated neighborhoods, in combination, can meaningfully influence how Americans travel.},

Key aspects of marketing applications include the discreteness of response or outcome data and relatively large numbers of cross-sectional units, each with possibly low information content. The use of informative priors including hierarchical models is essential for successful Bayesian applications in marketing. Given the importance of the prior, it is important to assure flexibility in the prior specification. Non-standard likelihoods and flexible priors make marketing a very challenging area for Bayesian applications.},

abstract = {This paper seeks to determine the factors underpinning changes in regional specialisation patterns in the European Union between 1991 and 2002. First, we consider a set of determinants previously identified in the regional literature, including agglomeration effects and other specific regional factors (business cycle, amount of investment, etc.). However, we then also take into account the fact that the evolution in a region’s specialisation pattern may be affected by the specialisation behaviour of other regions. Thus, not only do we consider the pattern of evolution in a region’s most proximate neighbours but we also examine that of their regional peers, i.e., regions with a similar specialisation pattern independent of their location. Notwithstanding, our empirical evidence indicates that physical distance still plays a very significant, and even more influential, role than similarity in specialisation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

@article{Hughes2006,
abstract = {ing the sensitivity of gasoline demand to changes in prices and income has important implications for policies related to climate change, optimal taxation and national security, to name only a few. While the short-run price and income elasticities of gasoline demand in the United States have been studied extensively, the vast majority of these studies focus on consumer behavior in the 1970s and 1980s. There are a number of reasons to believe that current demand elasticities differ from these previous periods, as transportation analysts have hypothesized that behavioral and structural factors over the past several decades have changed the responsiveness of U.S. consumers to changes in gasoline prices. In this paper, we compare the price and income elasticities of gasoline demand in two periods of similarly high prices from 1975 to 1980 and 2001 to 2006. The short-run price elasticities differ considerably and range from -0.034 to -0.077 during 2001 to 2006, versus -0.21 to -0.34 for 1975 to 1980. The estimated short-run income elasticities range from 0.21 to 0.75 and when estimated with the same models are not significantly different between the two periods. One implication of these findings is that gasoline taxes would need to be significantly larger today in order to achieve an equivalent reduction in gasoline consumption. This, coupled with the political difficulties in adopting gasoline taxes, suggests that policies and technologies designed to improve fuel economy are likely becoming relatively more attractive as a means to reduce fuel consumption.},

@article{Handy2002,
abstract = {The link between the built environment and human behavior has long been of interest to the field of urban planning, but direct assessments of the links between the built environment and physical activity as it influences personal health are still rare in the field. Yet the concepts, theories, and methods used by urban planners provide a foundation for an emerging body of research on the relationship between the built environment and physical activity. Recent research efforts in urban planning have focused on the idea that land use and design policies can be used to increase transit use as well as walking and bicycling. The development of appropriate measures for the built environment and for travel behavior is an essential element of this research. The link between the built environment and travel behavior is then made using theoretical frameworks borrowed from economics, and in particular, the concept of travel as a derived demand. The available evidence lends itself to the argument that a combination of urban design, land use patterns, and transportation systems that promotes walking and bicycling will help create active, healthier, and more livable communities. To provide more conclusive evidence, however, researchers must address the following issues: An alternative to the derived-demand framework must be developed for walking, measures of the built environment must be refined, and more-complete data on walking must be developed. In addition, detailed data on the built environment must be spatially matched to detailed data on travel behavior.},

abstract = {Energy issues receive more and more attention these days. And it is considered that technological progress is an essential approach to save energy. This essay is to analyze the relation between energy intensity and technological progress by Cobb-Douglas production function in which energy, labor, capital and technological progress are taken as independent variables. It proves that the growth of output per capital and output per labor will increase energy intensity while technological progress will decrease energy intensity. Empirical research on Chinese industry is used here to indicate technological progress greatly decreases energy intensity. Because of the interferences of Asian financial crisis, there is something abnormal in the data. So in the empirical research, average weaken buffer operator (ABWO) is applied to weaken the interference of Asian financial crisis to the fixed assets, energy and value added. The results of the empirical research show that technological progress decreases energy intensity of Chinese industry an average of 6.3{\%} every year in China.},

@article{Duncan2011,
abstract = {Neighborhood walkability can influence physical activity. We evaluated the validity of Walk Score(®) for assessing neighborhood walkability based on GIS (objective) indicators of neighborhood walkability with addresses from four US metropolitan areas with several street network buffer distances (i.e., 400-, 800-, and 1,600-meters). Address data come from the YMCA-Harvard After School Food and Fitness Project, an obesity prevention intervention involving children aged 5-11 years and their families participating in YMCA-administered, after-school programs located in four geographically diverse metropolitan areas in the US (n = 733). GIS data were used to measure multiple objective indicators of neighborhood walkability. Walk Scores were also obtained for the participant's residential addresses. Spearman correlations between Walk Scores and the GIS neighborhood walkability indicators were calculated as well as Spearman correlations accounting for spatial autocorrelation. There were many significant moderate correlations between Walk Scores and the GIS neighborhood walkability indicators such as density of retail destinations and intersection density (p < 0.05). The magnitude varied by the GIS indicator of neighborhood walkability. Correlations generally became stronger with a larger spatial scale, and there were some geographic differences. Walk Score(®) is free and publicly available for public health researchers and practitioners. Results from our study suggest that Walk Score(®) is a valid measure of estimating certain aspects of neighborhood walkability, particularly at the 1600-meter buffer. As such, our study confirms and extends the generalizability of previous findings demonstrating that Walk Score is a valid measure of estimating neighborhood walkability in multiple geographic locations and at multiple spatial scales.},

Respondents who had appraised such property report that power lines can affect residential property value to varying degrees under certain circumstances and that the market value of these properties is, on average, 10.01{\%} lower than the market value for comparable properties not subject to the influence of high voltage power lines. Further, the results indicate that even appraisers who had not appraised such property believe that power lines contribute negatively to property value.

@article{Abreu2004,
abstract = {This paper reviews the empirical literature on growth and convergence that has addressed the importance of spatial factors. An important distinction in this literature is the one between absolute and relative location. The literature on absolute location predominantly uses nonspatial econometric techniques, and is strongly linked to the economic growth literature. In contrast, studies on relative location tend to be weakly linked to theory, but apply relatively sophisticated econometric techniques to account for spatial effects. Most studies of the latter type are regional in nature, although there is a growing interest in extending the analysis to a cross-country setting. Both regional and cross-country studies typically make use of so-called spatial process models. Rather than modelling the impediments of space and distance directly, spatial process models start from exogenously provided information about the spatial structure. Our review shows that the usage of simple spatial autoregressive lag and error models abounds in the spatial econometrics literature. We assess the appropriateness of such models, and identify areas of potential concern. The rather weak linkage between theory and operational models, the dominance of global over local spatial association patterns, and the implicit restrictions on spatial interaction induced by many of the habitual specifications of the spatial weights matrix concurrently constitute areas where improvements can be made.},

@article{Wolsink2007,
abstract = {Public attitudes anywhere in Europe show moderate to strong support for the implementation of renewable energy. Nevertheless, planning wind power developments appears to be a complicated matter in most countries. The problems that have to be dealt with during decision making processes on the siting of wind turbines are usually referred to as mere [`]communication problems'. However, public attitudes towards wind power are fundamentally different from attitudes towards wind farms. This [`]gap' causes misunderstandings about the nature of public support for renewables. In particular where planners easily assume support for renewables can be generated by information campaigns emphasising the environmental benefits, whereas opposition to renewable energy schemes can be explained by a selfish [`]not in my backyard' attitude. Both explanations used by planners, authorities and, unfortunately, by many scholars, are falsified. Furthermore, policies that still take this [`]common knowledge' for granted can have negative consequences for the implementation rates of renewables. Visual evaluation of the impact of wind power on landscape values is by far the dominant factor in explaining why some are opposed to wind power and others are supporting it. Moreover, feelings about equity and fairness appear the determinants of [`]backyard' motives, instead of selfishness.},

@article{Lamptey2009,
abstract = {The surface energy budget has been used to illustrate the influence of urban landscape on both global and regional climate. This was done using empirical as well as remotely sensed data of components of the surface energy equation.At the global scale, the urban land cover has the least impact on the sensible and latent heat fluxes compared to the other land cover types. Replacing the urban land cover with vegetation did not result in a significant change to the proportionate values of the turbulent fluxes originally due to vegetation. The least impact of current urbanization on the global climate in terms of radiation and surface fluxes is because the urban land cover has the smallest fraction of all the land cover types.The relative importance of the urban landscape at the regional scale was illustrated using the example of Chester County and surroundings near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the USA. The urban effect becomes more important as the fraction of urban land cover to the total increases. This is illustrated by computing turbulent fluxes for 1987, 1988, 1991, 1993 and 1996 over the Chester County area. Urbanization in Chester County and surrounding areas increased from 11{\%} in 1987 to 19{\%} in 1996. In 1996, urban land cover produced the largest proportionate sensible (21.4 Wm-2) and latent (14.2 Wm-2) heat fluxes during winter. During the 1996 summer, urban and vegetation land cover produced the largest proportionate sensible heat (59.2 Wm-2) while urban land cover produced the second largest proportionate latent heat flux (39.5 Wm-2). The implications of this simple analytical study point to the need to account for the urban landscape particularly in regional studies. Copyright © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society},

@article{F.Dormann2007,
abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species' distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.},

After the substantial effort to standardize procedures for quantitatively determining major points along urban gradients using large scales ten years ago, recent studies have proposed novel definitions to define terms related to both habitat and landscape levels with the aim of describing specific study sites within urban systems. In this essay, I discuss the definition of several terms related to sites within urban systems (e.g., urban, suburban, peri-urban, non-urban, ex-urban, rural) and propose straightforward ways to standardize and accurately describe them. Undoubtedly, the use of well-defined terms in urban ecology studies will not only permit a better understanding of the nature of study sites across urban ecology studies and grant the possibility to perform robust comparisons among urban ecology studies, but could also aid policy makers and urban landscape planners and managers to enhance the ecological quality of urban systems around the globe.},

abstract = {The voucher scheme introduced in Chile in 1981 allows for-profit private subsidized schools to choose their students. The objective of this article is to present evidence of this practice and examine its relationship with academic performance using information from the 2005 SIMCE test, in which parents were asked about the admission requirements for their children's schools. We present evidence indicating that student selection is a widespread practice among private subsidized schools. Using OLS and after controlling for a series of selection criteria and the segmentation effects that they produce, the evidence indicates that there are no differences in results between public and private subsidized education. Our results show that a student attending a school that uses selection criteria obtains 7-9 percent higher results in standardized mathematics tests than a student from a school that does not use selection. The main conclusion of this study is that the basic belief behind the voucher system in Chile that competition will lead to better quality of all schools is not being met. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

abstract = {Surface evaporation is an important component of the urban energy balance, and its role in arid-zone cities may significantly differ from that observed in more temperate regions. However, the quantification of evapotranspiration is difficult in a complex urban setting, given the heterogeneity of the terrain and its various dry and wet elements. Here an open-air scaled urban surface (OASUS) is employed to quantify latent heat flux as a function of the surface area available for evaporation and the three-dimensional (3-D) urban geometry. The OASUS model consists of an extensive urban-like building/street array located in an arid Negev region of southern Israel (30.8°N, 480 m above sea level). Measurements were carried out during the summer month of August, and flux partitioning was analysed using evaporation pans of varying surface areas embedded in arrays of varying height. Results indicated that the increase in latent heat removal with respect to equivalent lsquovegetativersquo surface area was nearly linear. Increasing latent heat flux with lsquovegetated fractionrsquo was offset in approximately equal measure by decreases in storage and turbulent sensible heat flux. The proportion of the radiant energy budget represented by evaporative heat loss was also linked to the 3-D geometry of the array, increasing linearly with the ratio between vegetative cover and the lsquocompletersquo urban surface area.

abstract = {Reliable time-series is the basic ingredient when analysing climatic changes. However, the errors in real data are frequently of the same order as the signal being sought. Therefore, the available long-term monthly series of Spanish minimum and maximum temperatures have been compiled from the late 19th century on, in order to compile a high-quality data set. The series are organized into climatically homogeneous regional groups and, in each group, the detection and adjustment is based on relative homogeneity and an analysis of the stationarity of the whole set of temperature-difference series. These series are scanned with moving t, Alexandersson, and Mann-Kendall tests. The detected inhomogeneities are adjusted by weighted averages of the regional series. The method is iterative and advances in steps of detection, adjustment, and actualization. Individual inhomogeneous data are discarded and gaps are filled by similar weighted multiple means.For the analysis of the temperature evolution in the Iberian Peninsula, each region is finally represented by one local series and the regional average. The urban effect on minimum temperatures is adjusted by an empirical method, and for Madrid also by a correction derived from new homogenized data. Generally, rigorous homogeneity cannot be achieved because the initial data quality is deficient in many cases and metadata are sparse. Nevertheless, the data homogeneity and quality has been considerably enhanced: the total error margin in a series is of the order of 0.3 °C-0.4 °C, under consideration of a worst-case error accumulation. On the other hand, the number of inhomogeneities is considerable and their average amplitude is of the order of 1 °C reflecting the much larger error margin in the raw data. The homogenized dataset compiled constitutes an important basis for the subsequent detection of thermal changes in Spain in the last 130 years, on a clearly higher confidence level than before.

abstract = {After more than 25 years of continuous development, Danish wind-energy landscapes are due for face changes. On-shore construction has ceased and necessary re-powering schemes have not been introduced as yet. Regional planning is discouraging, while conditions for erecting new turbines have become more stringent. One of the factors inhibiting development seems to be uncertainty in planning about the future impact on landscapes. Visual impact has rarely been an issue so far, but ever-increasing turbine size and less local involvement may change this. This paper presents a deterministic approach of determining the likely visual-impact on landscapes and population, taking into account that there is no clear threshold for perceived adverse visual-impact. A geographical information system (GIS) has been used to build a regional landscape model for Northern Jutland County, which is used to assess visibility of turbines in the period of 1990 to 2010, based on historical and planning data. Multiple viewsheds are calculated for various thresholds of visual impact and overlaid with population and land-use data. The results show that a decrease in the number of turbines by about 40{\%} and an increase in installed capacity of 20{\%} will not add to the comparative impact in general. However, the pattern of visibility will become askew, and the present homogenous distribution of visibility will fade. This, together with changing ownership and receding local involvement, could ultimately lead to a decline in the popular acceptance of wind power.},

He also fails to grasp the implications of disequilibrium market process theory for the use of any kind of least-cost-avoider rule in the economic analysis of the law. As a result, Gunning's defense of Coase suffers from the same “pretense of knowledge” as the analysis that he is defending.},

@article{Roth2000,
abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive, critical review of turbulence observations over cities. More than fifty studies are analysed with their experimental conditions summarized in an appendix. The main results are based on 14 high-quality experiments which met criteria based on stringent experimental requirements. The observations are presented as non-dimensional statistics to facilitate comparison between urban studies and work conducted over other rough, inhomogeneous surfaces. Wake production associated with bluff bodies, and the inhomogeneous distribution of sources and sinks of scalars, result in a roughness sub-layer which for the studies reviewed extends to about 2.5 to 3 times the height of the buildings. It is shown that within this region the basis of several traditional micrometeorological approaches to describe the turbulent exchange is in doubt. There are strong similarities to flow over plant canopies, and many of the turbulence characteristics can be interpreted in the framework of a plane mixing layer. Future field observations should concentrate on the turbulent exchange near the top and within the urban canopy as well as within the urban boundary layer.},

abstract = {Growth management attempts to improve the ordering of development to improve outcomes. To taxpayers, growth management promises more efficient delivery of public facilities and services. To developers, growth management promises more certainty. To citizen activists, growth management promises resolution of development problems in advance, instead of on an ad hoc basis. These promises are heroic. Nonetheless, even if only partly successful, communities engaged in growth management should out-perform other communities in overall economic output. This paper evaluates the economic performance of 182 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with 1990 populations between 100,000 and 500,000 over the period 1972 to 1992 with respect to presence or absence of growth management efforts such as urban growth boundaries, urban service limits, and state or regional oversight of local planning. We find a positive association between the presence of growth management and economic performance; communities engaged in growth management realized marginal improvements in economic performance relative to other communities, ceteris parnbus.},

To this purpose, we fit the relevant time series through a class of linear models, known as Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (ARMA(p,q)) models. We define two indicators representing the total order and the total persistence of the process, linked, respectively, to the shape and to the characteristic decay time of the autocorrelation function of the process. We successfully test the method to detect transitions in a Langevin model and a 2D Ising model with nearest-neighbour interaction. We then apply the method to complex systems, namely for dynamo thresholds and financial crisis detection.},

abstract = {The current century—an era of environmental awareness—requires energy resources to satisfy the world's future energy demands. We can use current energy use scenarios to help us to understand how energy systems could change. Such scenarios are not an exercise in prophecy; rather they are designed to challenge our thinking in order to make better decisions today. The conventional modeling approach tends to extrapolate changes in energy consumption from historical trends; however, technology innovation sometimes causes drastic reforms in energy systems in the industrial, commercial, residential and transportation sectors. The economic aspects are another key issue to be considered in order to understand future changes in energy systems. The quantity of the energy supply is set to meet the price of the energy demand of end users. This occurs on the condition that the price of the energy supply equates with the price on the demand side under the market mechanism. This paper reviews the various issues associated with the energy-economic model and its application to national energy policies, renewable energy systems, and the global environment.

abstract = {The effect of electricity distribution equipment, in particular high-voltage overhead transmission lines (HVOTLs), on the value of residential property in England remains relatively unexplored due, in part, to the lack of available transaction data for analysis. This paper compares the results of two UK studies undertaken by the authors. The first is a national survey of property valuers' perceptions (Chartered Surveyors and members of the National Association of Estate Agents) of the presence of distribution equipment in close proximity to residential property. The results from this study are then compared with an analysis of transaction data from a case study in Scotland. This paper presents the initial findings from these studies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Brownstone2009,
abstract = {We specify and estimate a joint model of residential density, vehicle use, and fuel consumption that accounts for both self selection effects and missing data that are related to the endogenous variables. Our model is estimated on the California subsample of the 2001 U.S. National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). Comparing two California households that are similar in all respects except residential density, a lower density of 1000 housing units per square mile (roughly 40{\%} of the weighted sample average) implies an increase of 1200 miles driven per year (4.8{\%}) and 65 more gallons of fuel used per household (5.5{\%}). This total effect of residential density on fuel usage is decomposed into two paths of influence. Increased mileage leads to a difference of 45 gallons, but there is an additional direct effect of density through lower fleet fuel economy of 20 gallons per year, a result of vehicle type choice.},

abstract = {A house is made up of many characteristics, all of which may affect its value. Hedonic regression analysis is typically used to estimate the marginal contribution of these individual characteristics. This study provides a review of recent studies that have used hedonic modeling to estimate house prices. The findings indicate that slanted versus flat roof, sprinkler system, garden, bath, separate shower stall, double oven and gated community positively affect selling price while not having attic space, living in an earthquake zone, proximity to a hog farm, proximity to a landfill, proximity to high voltage lines, corporate-owned properties, percentage of Blacks or Hispanics in an area and properties that require flood insurance negatively affect selling price.

@article{Low2012,
abstract = {Comparing local employment portfolios against entrepreneurship, this research finds that local wage and salary job market prospects shape incentives for potential entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship may thus be more attractive in areas featuring high employment risk and/or low returns. This research contributes to the existing regional employment portfolio literature by using more disaggregated data at both the county and the commuting zone levels. Commuting zones in particular represent a broader spectrum of labor market agglomerations across both rural and urban areas to provide the most stringent and revealing tests of the interrelationship between local employment portfolios and the choice to pursue entrepreneurship. The authors find a U-shaped risk/return trade-off using employment variance and growth, consistent with the literature. They test their hypothesis with a model of regional entrepreneurship, incorporating the employment portfolio variables. This is the first known study to explore the hypothesized relationship between wage and salary employment portfolios and entrepreneurship, effectively synthesizing two previously disparate literatures. © The Author(s) 2012.},

@article{Arnfield2003,
abstract = {Progress in urban climatology over the two decades since the first publication of the International Journal of Climatology is reviewed. It is emphasized that urban climatology during this period has benefited from conceptual advances made in microclimatology and boundary-layer climatology in general. The role of scale, heterogeneity, dynamic source areas for turbulent fluxes and the complexity introduced by the roughness sublayer over the tall, rigid roughness elements of cities is described. The diversity of urban heat islands, depending on the medium sensed and the sensing technique, is explained. The review focuses on two areas within urban climatology. First, it assesses advances in the study of selected urban climatic processes relating to urban atmospheric turbulence (including surface roughness) and exchange processes for energy and water, at scales of consideration ranging from individual facets of the urban environment, through streets and city blocks to neighbourhoods. Second, it explores the literature on the urban temperature field. The state of knowledge about urban heat islands around 1980 is described and work since then is assessed in terms of similarities to and contrasts with that situation. Finally, the main advances are summarized and recommendations for urban climate work in the future are made. Copyright © 2003 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Are migration networks associated with lower capital costs, or the alleviation of capital constraints? We examine these questions with data measuring access to remittance flows among small-scale entrepreneurs in Mexico. Using a survey of more than 6000 self-employed workers and small firm owners located in 44 urban areas of Mexico, we estimate the impact of attachment to migration networks on the level of capital investment, the capital-output ratio, sales, and profits of microenterprises. The impact is identified from the geographic pattern of migration from Mexico driven by the completion of rail lines in the early 1900s. For the full sample of firms, we find that migration is associated with higher investment levels and higher profits, but not higher sales. The strongest effects on investment are in the categories of automobiles, tools and inventories. When the sample is limited to firms in high-capital sectors, investment, sales, and profits all increase with attachment to the migration networks, suggesting that attachment to the migration network alleviates capital constraints in those sectors.},

The simulations are derived from a three-district model of low-, middle-, and high-income school districts (calibrated to New York data) with housing stocks that vary within and across districts. In this model, it is demonstrated that school-district targeted vouchers are similar in their impact to nontargeted vouchers but vastly different from vouchers targeted to low-income households. Furthermore, strong migration effects are shown to significantly improve the likely equity consequences of voucher programs.},

@article{Piras2010,
abstract = {Urban ecology is a promising research field that could generate important information to be transferred into practical applications for urban landscape planning and management. However, the lack of homogeneity in technical terms used to describe urban-related sampling sites makes generalizations difficult to establish. After the substantial effort to standardize procedures for quantitatively determining major points along urban gradients using large scales ten years ago, recent studies have proposed novel definitions to define terms related to both habitat and landscape levels with the aim of describing specific study sites within urban systems. In this essay, I discuss the definition of several terms related to sites within urban systems (e.g., urban, suburban, peri-urban, non-urban, ex-urban, rural) and propose straightforward ways to standardize and accurately describe them. Undoubtedly, the use of well-defined terms in urban ecology studies will not only permit a better understanding of the nature of study sites across urban ecology studies and grant the possibility to perform robust comparisons among urban ecology studies, but could also aid policy makers and urban landscape planners and managers to enhance the ecological quality of urban systems around the globe.},

@article{Fanning2011,
abstract = {Real estate appraisal requires recognition of two different economic concepts: (1) the capital transaction market (buy/sell transaction market) and (2) the fundamental value of property use. This article shows that these economic concepts can have differing value indications when either market is in great flux. The problem is the two market segments are vacillating, at times with some interaction with each other, and at other times independent of each other. When the data overlaps are not correctly recognized or analyzed, the value conclusions can be uncertain. The solution may be to pick not just one market segment to use in a valuation— transaction data only or fundamental data only—but to know when to use data from each market segment, when to mix and when not to mix the data, and when to use the two different market segments to check results gained from the other.

@article{Berrigan2002,
abstract = {Background: Physical inactivity is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes. Results from the transportation literature suggest that aspects of the urban environment may influence walking for transportation. In this paper we examine the association between a proxy measure of the urban environment and walking behavior.

Methods: We analyzed the association between home age and walking behavior in U.S. adults using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95{\%} confidence intervals and to control for the effects of gender, race/ethnicity, age, education level, household income, and activity limitations.

Results: Adults who lived in homes built before 1946 and from 1946 to 1973 were significantly more likely to walk 1+ miles ≥20 times per month than those who lived in homes built after 1973. This association was present among people living in urban and suburban counties, but absent among those living in rural counties. The association was also found in models that controlled for gender, race/ethnicity, age, education, income, and any health-related activity limitation. Other forms of leisure-time physical activity were not independently associated with home age.

Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that environmental variables influence walking frequency and suggest that home age may be a useful proxy for features of the urban environment that influence physical activity in the form of walking. Such proxy measures could facilitate testing ecologic models of health behavior using survey data.},

abstract = {Structured additive regression (STAR) models provide a flexible framework for modeling possible nonlinear effects of covariates: They contain the well established frameworks of generalized linear models (GLM) and generalized additive models (GAM) as special cases but also allow a wider class of effects, e.g., for geographical or spatio-temporal data, allowing for specification of complex and realistic models. BayesX is standalone software package providing software for fitting general class of STAR models. Based on a comprehensive open-source regression toolbox written in C++, BayesX uses Bayesian inference for estimating STAR models based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation techniques, a mixed model representation of STAR models, or stepwise regression techniques combining penalized least squares estimation with model selection. BayesX not only covers models for responses from univariate exponential families, but also models from less-standard regression situations such as models for multi-categorical responses with either ordered or unordered categories, continuous time survival data, or continuous time multi-state models. This paper presents a new fully interactive R interface to BayesX: the R package R2BayesX. With the new package, STAR models can be conveniently specified using R's formula language (with some extended terms), fitted using the BayesX binary, represented in R with objects of suitable classes, and finally printed/summarized/plotted. This makes BayesX much more accessible to users familiar with R and adds extensive graphics capabilities for visualizing fitted STAR models. Furthermore, R2BayesX complements the already impressive capabilities for semiparametric regression in R by a comprehensive toolbox comprising in particular more complex response types and alternative inferential procedures such as simulation-based Bayesian inference.},

abstract = {We review the usefulness of urban spatial economic models of land use change for the study and policy analysis of spatial land use–environment interactions. We find that meaningful progress has been made in econometric and monocentric models extended to account for multiple sources of spatial heterogeneity and in the development of general equilibrium models with spatial dynamics. Despite these advances, more work is needed in developing models with greater realism. Most agent-based computational models of urban land use change currently lack economic fundamentals, but provide a flexible means of linking microlevel behavior and interactions with macrolevel land use dynamics. In combination with empirical methods to identify parameters, this framework provides a promising approach to modeling spatial land use dynamics and policy effects. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

abstract = {Microclimate formation and its significance in urban planning was examined through two components that predominate in affecting the city's climate: built-up morphology and urban shade trees.The methodological approach focus is on a generalization procedure for quantifying the thermal effect of any studied situation through parameterization of the vegetated variables and the built-up forms. The analysis is integrative, using empirical climatic data followed by an analytical study for generalization and sensitivity analysis using an integrative model, the Green CTTC model.Three urban tree species predominant in the Tel Aviv gardens and streets, with different canopy characteristics, and three levels of building densities were analysed to determine their thermal effect on an urban street microclimate. The variables were parameterized according to six basic cooling attributes for the studied tree species in urban gardens in Tel Aviv, and according to three geometric built-up parameters for the studied urban street.The integrative modelling approach of considering all changes simultaneously was illustrated on an urban boulevard in Tel Aviv. The analysis demonstrates the shortcomings of piecemeal modelling and the merits of the integrative approach.The study indicates the importance of urban trees in alleviating the heat island effect in a hot and humid summer. The tree cooling effect was found to be strongly related to the built form geometry. In all the studied cases, the thermal effect of the tree was found to depend mainly on its canopy coverage level and planting density in the urban street and little on other species characteristics.The methodology of analysis presented in this paper can be applied to develop an operational tool in assessing for an urban open space the integrative thermal effects of different tree species, and of the varied urban morphology and the interaction between them.

@article{Toke2005,
abstract = {This paper discusses the factors that influence the outcome of onshore windfarm planning application in England and Wales. Various qualitative and quantitative methods have been employed, including regression analysis. Strong associations have been discovered between the outcome of local authority planning decisions, the opinions of local planning officers, the opinions of parish councils where the proposed windfarms are to be sited and the opinions of landscape protection groups. The attitude of people in the immediate vicinity of proposed windfarms is found to be the most important influence on the decisions made by local authorities. However, the local perception of the economic impact is of crucial importance in forming this judgement, as is the national political environment. The expected attitude of Appeal Inspectors is also important. It is concluded that there is a lot that wind power developers could do to improve the prospects of planning success. This includes engaging in local [`]parish council' politics, talking to the closest residents to proposed schemes and encouraging local pro-wind power campaigns. Future projects are likely to be favoured by installing viewing towers at the tops of turbines to encourage visitors and in selling shares in the schemes to local people.},

The model's results demonstrate that over short periods of time, cap rates can be predicted by macroeconomic and financial market conditions combined with commercial real estate market fundamentals.

abstract = {Regional climate change was demonstrated to be likely influenced by anthropogenic dominated land surface processes. Urban heat island (UHI) is one of the important outcomes of such land surface processes induced by urbanization, and it is an urban climate phenomenon influenced by land use pattern and it represents the difference in albedo, roughness, and heat flux exchange of land surface. This study tries to examine the influence of land use change on UHI in greater Guangzhou from 1980-2007 by analysing Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+ and MODIS satellite data, meteorological records, and census data. An integrated and modified single-channel method was used to retrieve land surface temperature (LST). Decadal changes in land use fraction and UHI pattern show that cropland decreased in parallel to the increase in built-up area and the correlation coefficient reached 0.97. The UHI effect expanded from urban areas to surrounding suburban areas and countryside with an increase in land surface temperature (mean LST increased by 2.48 from 1990 to 2007) and a decrease in the green vegetation fraction (GVF) (mean GVF decreased by 0.16 from 1990 to 2007). The spatial heterogeneity of UHI expansion can be explained by spatial patterns of economic development, population increase, and abundance of vegetation cover. In addition, remarkable changes in air temperature due to relocation of meteorological stations are significant signals for detecting the influence of urbanization on urban heat island.

Our model is estimated on the California subsample of the 2001 U.S. National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). Comparing two California households that are similar in all respects except residential density, a lower density of 1000 housing units per square mile (roughly 40{\%} of the weighted sample average) implies an increase of 1200 miles driven per year (4.8{\%}) and 65 more gallons of fuel used per household (5.5{\%}). This total effect of residential density on fuel usage is decomposed into two paths of influence. Increased mileage leads to a difference of 45 gallons, but there is an additional direct effect of density through lower fleet fuel economy of 20 gallons per year, a result of vehicle type choice.},

abstract = {Energy issues receive more and more attention these days. And it is considered that technological progress is an essential approach to save energy. This essay is to analyze the relation between energy intensity and technological progress by Cobb-Douglas production function in which energy, labor, capital and technological progress are taken as independent variables. It proves that the growth of output per capital and output per labor will increase energy intensity while technological progress will decrease energy intensity. Empirical research on Chinese industry is used here to indicate technological progress greatly decreases energy intensity. Because of the interferences of Asian financial crisis, there is something abnormal in the data. So in the empirical research, average weaken buffer operator (ABWO) is applied to weaken the interference of Asian financial crisis to the fixed assets, energy and value added. The results of the empirical research show that technological progress decreases energy intensity of Chinese industry an average of 6.3{\%} every year in China.},

abstract = {Recent contributions to the regional science literature have considered spatial effects in empirical growth specifications. In the case of spatial dependence, following theoretical arguments from new economic geography, and endogenous growth models, this phenomenon has been associated with the existence of externalities that cross regional borders. However, despite the general consensus that interactions or externalities are likely to be the major source of spatial dependence, they have been modelled in a rather ad hoc manner in most existing empirical studies. In contrast, we advocate basing the analysis on structural growth models which include externalities across economies, applying the appropriate spatial econometrics tools to test for their presence and estimate the magnitude of these externalities in the real world.},

Our analysis is conducted on a cross-section of 107 countries; we focus on national causes and consequences of the crisis, ignoring cross-country "contagion" effects. Our model of the incidence of the crisis combines 2008 changes in real GDP, the stock market, country credit ratings, and the exchange rate. We explore the linkages between these manifestations of the crisis and a number of its possible causes from 2006 and earlier. We include over sixty potential causes of the crisis, covering such categories as: financial system policies and conditions; asset price appreciation in real estate and equity markets; international imbalances and foreign reserve adequacy; macroeconomic policies; and institutional and geographic features. Despite the fact that we use a wide number of possible causes in a flexible statistical framework, we are unable to link most of the commonly cited causes of the crisis to its incidence across countries. This negative finding in the cross-section makes us skeptical of the accuracy of "early warning" systems of potential crises, which must also predict their timing. © 2011.},

@article{LeSage1999,
abstract = {This text provides an introduction to spatial econometric theory along with numerous applied illustrations of the models and methods described. The applications utilize a set of MATLAB functions that implement a host of spatial econometric estimation methods. The intended audience is faculty,studen ts and practitioners involved in modeling spatial data sets. The MATLAB functions described in this book have been used in my own research as well as teaching both undergraduate and graduate econometrics courses. They are available on the Internet at http://www.econ.utoledo.edu along with the data sets and examples from the text. The theory and applied illustrations of conventional spatial econometric models represent about half of the content in this text,with the other half devoted to Bayesian alternatives. Conventional maximum likelihood estimation for a class of spatial econometric models is discussed in one chapter,follo wed by a chapter that introduces a Bayesian approach for this same set of models. It is well-known that Bayesian methods implemented with a diffuse prior simply reproduce maximum likelihood results,and we illustrate this point. However, the main motivation for introducing Bayesian methods is to extend the conventional models. Comparative illustrations demonstrate how Bayesian methods can solve problems that confront the conventional models. Recent advances in Bayesian estimation that rely on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods make it easy to estimate these models. This approach to estimation has been implemented in the spatial econometric function library described in the text, so estimation using the Bayesian models require a single additional line in your computer program. Some of the Bayesian methods have been introduced in the regional science literature,or presented at conferences. Space and time constraints prohibit any discussion of implementation details in these forums. This text describes the implementation details,whic h I believe greatly enhance understanding and allow users to make intelligent use of these methods in applied settings. Audiences have been amazed (and perhaps skeptical) when I tell them it takes only 10 seconds to generate a sample of 1,000 MCMC draws from a sequence of conditional distributions needed to estimate the Bayesian models. Implementation approaches that achieve this type of speed are described here in the hope that other researchers can apply these ideas in their own work. I have often been asked about Monte Carlo evidence for Bayesian spatial econometric methods. Large and small sample properties of estimation procedures are frequentist notions that make no sense in a Bayesian setting. The best support for the efficacy of Bayesian methods is their ability to provide solutions to applied problems. Hopefully,the ease of using these methods will encourage readers to experiment with these methods and compare the Bayesian results to those from more conventional estimation methods. Implementation details are also provided for maximum likelihood methods that draw on the sparse matrix functionality of MATLAB and produce rapid solutions to large applied problems with a minimum of computer memory. I believe the MATLAB functions for maximum likelihood estimation of conventional models presented here represent fast and efficient routines that are easier to use than any available alternatives. Talking to colleagues at conferences has convinced me that a simple software interface is needed so practitioners can estimate and compare a host of alternative spatial econometric model specifications. An example in Chapter 5 produces estimates for ten different spatial autoregressive models,including maximum likelihood,robust Bayesian,and a robust Bayesian tobit model. Estimation, prin ting and plotting of results for all these models is accomplished with a 39 line program. Many researchers ignore sample truncation or limited dependent variables because they face problems adapting existing spatial econometric software to these types of sample data. This text describes the theory behind robust Bayesian logit/probit and tobit versions of spatial autoregressive models and geographically weighted regression models. It also provides implementation details and software functions to estimate these models. Toolboxes are the name given by the MathWorks to related sets of MATLAB functions aimed at solving a particular class of problems. Toolboxes of functions useful in signal and a host of other areas are available from the MathWorks as add-ons to the standard MATLAB software distribution. I use the term Econometrics Toolbox to refer to my public domain collection of function libraries available at the internet address given above. The MATLAB spatial econometrics functions used to implement the spatial econometric models discussed in this text rely on many of the functions in the Econometrics Toolbox. The spatial econometric functions constitute a library within the broader set of econometric functions. To use the spatial econometrics function library you need to download and install the entire set of Econometrics Toolbox functions. The spatial econometrics function library is part of the Econometrics Toolbox and will be available for use along with more traditional econometrics functions. The collection of around 500 econometrics functions and demonstration programs are organized into libraries, with approximately 40 spatial econometrics library functions described in this text. A manual is available for the Econometrics Toolbox in Acrobat PDF and postscript on the internet site,but this text should provide all the information needed to use the spatial econometrics library. A consistent design was implemented that provides documentation,example programs,and functions to produce printed as well as graphical presentation of estimation results for all of the econometric and spatial econometric functions. This was accomplished using the structure variables introduced in MATLAB Version 5. Information from estimation procedures is encapsulated into a single variable that contains fields for individual parameters and statistics related to the econometric results. A thoughtful design by the MathWorks allows these structure variables to contain scalar,v ector,matrix,string,and even multidimensional matrices as fields. This allows the econometric functions to return a single structure that contains all estimation results. These structures can be passed to other functions that intelligently decipher the information and provide a printed or graphical presentation of the results. The Econometrics Toolbox along with the spatial econometrics library functions should allow faculty to use MATLAB in undergraduate and graduate level courses with absolutely no programming on the part of students or faculty. Practitioners should be able to apply the methods described in this text to problems involving large spatial data samples using an input program with less than 50 lines. Researchers should be able to modify or extend the existing functions in the spatial econometrics library. They can also draw on the utility routines and other econometric functions in the Econometrics Toolbox to implement and test new spatial econometric approaches. I have returned from conferences and implemented methods from papers that were presented in an hour or two by drawing on the resources of the Econometrics Toolbox. This text has another goal,applied modeling strategies and data analysis. Given the ability to easily implement a host of alternative models and produce estimates rapidly,atten tion naturally turns to which models best summarize a particular spatial data sample. Much of the discussion in this text involves these issues. My experience has been that researchers tend to specialize,one group is devoted to developing new econometric procedures,and another group focuses on applied problems that involve using existing methods. This text should have something to offer both groups. If those developing new spatial econometric procedures are serious about their methods,they should take the time to craft a generally useful MATLAB function that others can use in applied research. The spatial econometrics function library provides an illustration of this approach and can be easily extended to include new functions. It would also be helpful if users who produce generally useful functions that extend the spatial econometrics library would submit them for inclusion. This would have the added benefit of introducing these new research methods to faculty and their students. There are obviously omissions,bugs and perhaps programming errors in the Econometrics Toolbox and the spatial econometrics library functions. This would likely be the case with any such endeavor. I would be grateful if users would notify me via e-mail at they encounter problems. The toolbox is constantly undergoing revision and new functions are being added. If youre using these functions,up date to the latest version every few months and youll enjoy speed improvements along with the benefits of new methods. Instructions for downloading and installing these functions are in an Appendix to this text along with a listing of the functions in the library and a brief description of each. Numerous people have helped in my spatial econometric research efforts and the production of this text. John Geweke explained the mysteries of MCMC estimation when I was a visiting scholar at the Minneapolis FED. He shared his FORTRAN code and examples without which MCMC estimation might still be a mystery. Luc Anselin with his encylopedic knowledge of the field was kind enough to point out errors in my early work on MCMC estimation of the Bayesian models and set me on the right track. He has always been encouraging and quick to point out that he explored Bayesian spatial econometric m},

abstract = {Since the first statement of Hicks's induced innovation hypothesis in 1932, a large number of theoretical and empirical studies have analyzed the issue of price-induced technological change—many of them on the basis of substitution elasticities. This note compares technologies across space and time on the basis of factual and counterfactual substitution elasticities and argues that differences in estimated substitution elasticities should be decomposed into two counterfactual components. The first component is designed to indicate how the ease of substitution is altered by varied economic circumstances; the second addresses the question of how technologies would compare under genuinely comparable situations. This argument is illustrated by the example of energy-price elasticities of capital before and after the oil crisis of the early 1970s.},

abstract = {Cities are the cradle of a wide range of cultural, social, and technological innovations that are at the heart of modern economic growth and development. Half of humanity today lives in cities but, until the last two decades, economists have paid much less attention to cities than have other social scientists. By contrast, geographers have long studied the role of cities in human affairs. Michael Batty, a distinguished scholar in the field of human geography, has recently written The New Science of Cities, a synthesis of his work and of some other prominent urban geographers. A review of his book is the first objective of this essay. The second is to discuss and compare the tools and concepts developed by urban economists with those of urban geographers in the hope of triggering a fruitful debate between those two groups of social scientists.

abstract = {This article appraises recent advances in the spatial econometric literature. It serves as the introduction to a collection of new papers on spatial econometric data analysis brought together in this special issue, dealing specifically with new extensions to the spatial econometric modeling perspective. Although the initial development of the field of spatial econometrics has been rather slow, the Dixit-Stiglitz revolution and the emergence of the New Economy Geography have been instrumental in uplifting the significance and the use of spatial data analysis techniques. Concurrent developments in other social sciences parallel this situation in economics. The upsurge in spatial econometrics is, among other things, driven by the recognition that traditional spatial econometric models are insufficient to capture modern theoretical developments. Therefore, this issue brings together a collection of articles on space-time and discrete choice modeling, spatial nonstationarity, and the methodology and empirics of regional economic growth models.},

abstract = {Small-scale human societies range from foraging bands with a strong egalitarian ethos to more economically stratified agrarian and pastoral societies. We explain this variation in inequality using a dynamic model in which a population's long-run steady-state level of inequality depends on the extent to which its most important forms of wealth are transmitted within families across generations. We estimate the degree of intergenerational transmission of three different types of wealth (material, embodied, and relational), as well as the extent of wealth inequality in 21 historical and contemporary populations. We show that intergenerational transmission of wealth and wealth inequality are substantial among pastoral and small-scale agricultural societies (on a par with or even exceeding the most unequal modern industrial economies) but are limited among horticultural and foraging peoples (equivalent to the most egalitarian of modern industrial populations). Differences in the technology by which a people derive their livelihood and in the institutions and norms making up the economic system jointly contribute to this pattern.},

Industry sources suggested that investments of {\$}50-100 billion would be needed. This work seeks to better understand an important piece of information that has been missing from these discussions: what do power interruptions and fluctuations in power quality (power-quality events) cost electricity consumers? We developed a bottom-up approach for assessing the cost to US electricity consumers of power interruptions and power-quality events (referred to collectively as "reliability events"). The approach can be used to help assess the potential benefits of investments in improving the reliability of the grid. We developed a new estimate based on publicly available information, and assessed how uncertainties in these data affect this estimate using sensitivity analysis. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The growing economy with corresponding increase in power demand causes more challenges in power sector of developing countries. In India, the increase in peak power demand necessitates energy storage schemes over and above the storage - hydro-, oil- and gas-based peak power plants to ensure power system stability. In utility energy storage schemes, the Pumped storage schemes attract more attention even in the developed countries due to its unique operational flexibility over other energy storage systems. In India, the availability of suitable topographies, hydro-thermal ratio imbalance in various regions, and optimal storage capacity for flexible power system operation gives a thought for the planers and executors to implement these schemes to meet peak demands. This paper presents a critical review of the necessity of pumped storage schemes in India. This review reveals that the major constraint for pumped storage operation in India is the deficit of off-peak power available in all the regional grids except north-east region for pumping at present. But the current adversity is likely to be gradually solved by the commissioning of newly proposed power projects. Fixing of a separate operational tariff for pumped storage schemes throughout the country is another requirement for which the government has set up a one man committee to analyze the feasibility for this peak tariff. Non-availability of lower tail pools and irrigation needs also causes poor pumping operations in some cases. However, most of the states in India are evincing interest in pumped storage schemes and proposals are being submitted to central government for securing stations clearance. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {To examine the potential benefits of energy storage in the electric grid, a generalized unit commitment model of thermal generating units and energy storage facilities is developed. Three different storage scenarios were tested-two without limits to total storage assignment and one with a constrained maximum storage portfolio. Given a generation fleet based on the City of Austin's renewable energy deployment plans, results from the unlimited energy storage deployment scenarios studied show that if capital costs are ignored, large quantities of seasonal storage are preferred. This operational approach enables storage of plentiful wind generation during winter months that can then be dispatched during high cost peak periods in the summer. These two scenarios yielded {\$}70 million and {\$}94 million in yearly operational cost savings but would cost hundreds of billions to implement. Conversely, yearly cost reductions of {\$}40 million can be achieved with one compressed air energy storage facility and a small set of electrochemical storage devices totaling 13 GWh of capacity. Similarly sized storage fleets with capital costs, service lifetimes, and financing consistent with these operational cost savings can yield significant operational benefit by avoiding dispatch of expensive peaking generators and improving utilization of renewable generation throughout the year. Further study using a modified unit commitment model can help to clarify optimal storage portfolios, reveal appropriate market participation approaches, and determine the optimal siting of storage within the grid.

abstract = {The burning of depleting fossil fuels for power generation has detrimental impact on human life and climate. In view of this, renewable solar energy sources are being increasingly exploited to meet the energy needs. Moreover, solar photovoltaic (PV)-diesel hybrid system technology promises lot of opportunities in remote areas which are far from utility grid and are driven by diesel generators. Integration of PV systems with the diesel plants is being disseminated worldwide to reduce diesel fuel consumption and to minimize atmospheric pollution. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (K.S.A.) being endowed with high intensity of solar radiation, is a prospective candidate for deployment of PV systems. Also, K.S.A. has large number of remote scattered villages. The aim of this study is to analyze solar radiation data of Rafha, K.S.A., to assess the techno-economic feasibility of hybrid PV-diesel-battery power systems to meet the load requirements of a typical remote village Rawdhat Bin Habbas (RBH) with annual electrical energy demand of 15,943 MWh. Rafha is located near RBH. The monthly average daily global solar radiation ranges from 3.04 to 7.3 kWh/m2. NREL's HOMER software has been used to perform the techno-economic evaluation. The simulation results indicate that for a hybrid system composed of 2.5 MWp capacity PV system together with 4.5 MW diesel system (three 1.5 MW units) and a battery storage of 1 h of autonomy (equivalent to 1 h of average load), the PV penetration is 27{\%}. The cost of generating energy (COE, US{\$}/kWh) from the above hybrid system has been found to be 0.170{\$}/kWh (assuming diesel fuel price of 0.1{\$}/l). The study exhibits that the operational hours of diesel generators decrease with increase in PV capacity. The investigation also examines the effect of PV/battery penetration on COE, operational hours of diesel gensets. Concurrently, emphasis has been placed on: un-met load, excess electricity generation, percentage fuel savings and reduction in carbon emissions (for different scenarios such as: PV-diesel without storage, PV-diesel with storage, as compared to diesel-only situation), COE of different hybrid systems, etc. The decrease in carbon emissions by using the above hybrid system is about 24{\%} as compared to the diesel-only scenario. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Used effectively, battery storage can increase the versatility of a micro-generation system by satisfying the highly variable electrical load of an individual dwelling, therefore changing usage patterns on the national grid (Jenkins et al 2008). In addition, a significant shift towards electric or hybrid cars would also increase the number of batteries required. However, batteries can be inefficient and comprise of materials that have high environmental and energy impacts. In addition, some materials, such as lithium, are scarce natural resources. As a result, the overall impact of increasing our reliance on such “sustainable” systems may in fact have an additional detrimental impact. This paper outlines previous work in this area, and reviews the data available about battery production and use in terms of their life cycle environmental and energy impacts. Problems associated with resource availability are also highlighted. The impact of the production of batteries is examined and presented in order that future studies may be able to include the impact of batteries more easily within any system.},

Injected and produced power constraints, storage, air balance and CAES-operation limits are considered in the CAES modelling. Two objective functions (profit maximisation and cost minimisation) are modelled.

abstract = {As large-scale photovoltaic (PV) generation reaches higher penetration levels, there is a greater need to meet the certain grid code requirements for interconnection. Ultracapacitor, battery energy storage system (BESS) or shunt capacitor have recently been used as auxiliary devices for large-scale PV generator system to meet the grid code requirements for interconnection. Although the individual auxiliary devices are well documented, a comparative study of these devices impact on the damping of electromechanical (EM) modes and oscillatory instability problem has not been reported so far. This paper aims to fill in the gap, and provides a comparative analysis of these auxiliary devices performance along with PV plant on the damping of EM modes. The oscillation problem is analyzed by considering different types of synchronous generator (e.g. hydro, thermal) as the non-electrical components of hydro and thermal units have major influences on system dynamics. The comparisons are based on the results obtained from two-area test system and New England-New York test system (16 machine 68 bus system), which are the benchmark systems for angular stability analysis. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Nuclear power currently supports the goals of the European Union low-carbon society by being a dependable source of energy, while emitting no CO 2. In the future, more flexible nuclear systems could enable wind to achieve a 50{\%} share of the renewable contribution to the energy mix. Small and medium-sized reactors (SMRs) could provide firming power generation to back-up the supply from renewable resources and follow-load. This study involves the hypothetical combination of an off-shore wind farm and a SMR, operated together as a virtual power plant (VPP). Results using wind data from the North Sea indicate that the combination results in 80{\%} less wind power variation to the grid, effectively creating a virtual baseload power plant. This gain comes at the loss of 30{\%} SMR capacity utilization. The research identified that the reduction of 1000MW off-shore wind farm variability was best achieved with 700MW SMRs using 100MW modules. In demand-following mode the VPP could maneuver output to improve synchronization with demand by 60-70{\%} over a wind-only system. Power variability was indifferent to the SMR module size. The VPP could not reduce 100{\%} of the wind variation, as additional balancing measures (e.g., smart grid, storage, and hybrid-nuclear systems) are still needed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper addresses the operation (charging/discharging) problem of battery energy storage installed in a wind generation system in order to improve the value of wind power in the real-time market. Depending on the prediction of market prices and the probabilistic information of wind generation, wind power producers can schedule the battery energy storage for the next day in order to maximize the profit. In addition, by taking into account the expenses of using batteries, the proposed charging/discharging scheme is able to avoid the detrimental operation of battery energy storage which can lead to a significant reduction of battery lifetime, i.e., uneconomical operation. The problem is formulated in a dynamic programming framework and solved by a dynamic programming backward algorithm. The proposed scheme is then applied to the study cases, and the results of simulation show its effectiveness.},

Both solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind energy have variable and uncertain (sometimes referred to as intermittent) output, which are unlike the dispatchable sources used for the majority of electricity generation in the United States. The variability of these sources has led to concerns regarding the reliability of an electric grid that derives a large fraction of its energy from these sources as well as the cost of reliably integrating large amounts of variable generation into the electric grid.

Such a grid clearly requires some conventional generating capacity to be available in order to serve as backup at times when the PV-storage combination alone fails to meet the demand. In the present continuation of that study, we evaluate the largest conventional capacity that would have been required during the one year of data employed for our simulations. For that year, 2006, the required backup capacity for a grid with flexibility ff=0.8 and ff=1 would have been 7.5. GW and 6.6. GW, respectively. This is significantly less than the 10.5. GW of generating capacity that the Israel Electric Corporation operated that year. Our finding emphasizes the fact that a full economic optimization of storage must be based primarily on the engineering-aspects of storage design and use. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The present study aims to investigate the performance of a pumped storage unit introduced in a conventional Hydroelectric Power Plant in Greece. At first, the plant operation and the electric grid data for a reference period of one year are used to compute the time variation of water inflow into the dam, and to estimate the RES production rejections depending on the installed power. Next, a pumping station powered by the rejected RES production and raising water from an adjacent downstream reservoir is modeled. Various scenarios concerning the pumping station power rate and feeding program are examined. The operation of the combined system is simulated in detail and the energy results are analyzed. Also, an economic evaluation is carried out based on current financial conditions in Greece. The results showed that a considerable amount of excess RES production can be stored, but the economic viability of the investment depends on some critical parameters, which are identified. Certain guidelines concerning the optimum sizing and operation strategy of the pumped storage scheme are finally extracted. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

To demonstrate the technique, we consider a radial distribution circuit with a single branch consisting of sequentially-arranged residential-scale loads that consume both real and reactive power. In parallel, some loads also have PV generation capability. We postulate that the inverters associated with each PV system are also capable of limited reactive power generation or consumption, and we seek to find the optimal dispatch of each inverter's reactive power to both maintain the voltage within an acceptable range and minimize the resistive losses over the entire circuit. We assume the complex impedance of the distribution circuit links and the instantaneous load and PV generation at each load are known. We compare the results of the optimal dispatch with a suboptimal local scheme that does not require any communication. On our model distribution circuit, we illustrate the feasibility of high levels of PV penetration and a significant (20{\%} or higher) reduction in losses.},

The contractual agreement with a compressed air energy storage facility (CAES) would create a hybrid wind-storage system that would allow a wind power operator to reduce the intermittency of its output and to provide flexibility to the system. The study gives a market value to the wind power at a project level of several gigawatts capacity located in France, by using a technical and economic optimization model. Results indicate the cost of balancing the intermittency for the wind operator and show that under baseline conditions, the hybrid wind-storage system would have negative profits despite price arbitrage operations and ancillary services provided to the system. Alternative tests show that the economics can improve when the influence of the wind power on the spot price is accounted for. The study is focused on the long term market situation in France, which is characterized by increased balancing needs, an ageing infrastructure, uncertainties in carbon and gas prices, and increased power imports. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {One of the main characteristics of wind power is the inherent variability and uncontrollability. Even with state-of-the art forecasting techniques, actual wind generation can be substantially deviated from the forecasted values. In addition, the system load is also variable and needs to be forecasted ahead of time for unit commitment and system planning and operation purposes. Although daily loads follow a pattern, every forecast is associated with a certain degree of uncertainty. In a system consisting of only wind generation and load, with minimum or no connection to the grid, the task of energy balancing is extremely difficult. Incorporation of energy storage units is being considered as a possible solution to this problem. However, energy storage units till date are expensive. Hence the question that arises is, given a generation-load system, what is the optimal amount of storage required. This paper investigates the storage size required by a system consisting of a wind farm and a load in meeting certain specified reliability indices. The optimization model is formulated as a stochastic linear programming problem considering two random quantities, load and wind generation. The minimum initial energy required in the storage unit is also computed. The reliability index of the system is evaluated in terms of the LOLP (Loss of Load Probability). Another reliability index, SGP (Spilled Generation Probability), is defined to determine the probability of a wind energy spillage event due to excess wind generation that cannot be accommodated in the system. A realistic example case is presented where the developed methodology is tested with satisfactory results.},

This paper proposes an optimization model to decide the rated power and capacity of a CAES system, which is crucial to maximizing economical profits. This methodology involves several steps. Firstly, the constraints of the CAES system’s rated power are considered, which include the CAES system’s compensation for power shortages during peak load period, the influence of the operation on power flow and the impact on the system when CAES is switched. Secondly, an exponential distribution is adopted to calculate wind power curtailment at night, based on which the benefits from recovering wind power curtailment can be estimated. Finally, the economical profits are optimized according to the CAES investment cost, operation cost and turnout. The results show that the proposed methodology can provide a referential guidance for CAES sizing according to different situations in practice.},

abstract = {This study analyzes power storage as a key option to support wind energy integration. The case study is the French power system, whose characteristics rely on high rates of nuclear power and a strong emerging wind energy market. A dynamic optimization dispatching model is used to simulate the operation of the power system, under two development scenarios of the technology mix by 2030, one scenario documented by European Commission, EC [1], and a second one by French Transmission System Operator, RTE [2]. Both scenarios result in power storage requirements of around 7 TWh for more than 4 GW installed storage capacity of pumped hydro power plants in France as a whole. In this context, it is assessed the profitability of an additional regional project of Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) located in the region of Bretagne. It shows how benefits could accrue by avoiding the regional wind curtailment of 59 GWh, by providing ancillary services such as secondary reserve, and by increasing the use of grid assets and the nuclear power output with more than 230 GWh. The profitability of the CAES project remains however negative, around -70 /MWh despite the social value and the system benefits that results in. The study assesses qualitatively possible ways to incentivize the investment in new storage projects, through for instance contracts for difference, which would link the storage operation, its investment cost and stage of development to the power market design via power prices and a pre-defined rate of return. The periodical revision of these regulatory arrangements would enable the storage investor to recover the investment cost and would eliminate the risk of over rewarding generators in the case of windfall profits. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The integration of renewable energy resources (RER) into an existing distribution system is an important topic in dealing with energy challenge the world is facing. With rapid development of electric energy storage (EES) technologies, there is a growing interest in integrating both EES and RER into power systems to improve their reliability and economy. In this paper, the adequacy and economy of distribution systems integrated with both EES and RER are assessed. A novel model predictive control (MPC)-based operation strategy is presented to minimize distribution system energy purchasing cost by coordinating multiple power supplies from EES, RER and external grid. An islanding operation is implemented to improve the distribution system reliability and reduce customer interruption cost. A reliability and economy assessment framework based on sequential Monte Carlo method integrated with the MPC-based operation and islanding operation is proposed. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate the reliability and economy improvement by implementing the proposed operation strategies together with integration of EES and RER, and also investigate how EES capacity, power limit, and wind turbine generation capacity affect system reliability and economy.

abstract = {Electric-drive vehicles can provide power to the electric grid when they are parked (vehicle-to-grid power). We evaluated the economic potential of two utility-owned fleets of battery-electric vehicles to provide power for a specific electricity market, regulation, in four US regional regulation services markets. The two battery-electric fleet cases are: (a) 100 Th!nk City vehicle and (b) 252 Toyota RAV4. Important variables are: (a) the market value of regulation services, (b) the power capacity (kW) of the electrical connections and wiring, and (c) the energy capacity (kWh) of the vehicle's battery. With a few exceptions when the annual market value of regulation was low, we find that vehicle-to-grid power for regulation services is profitable across all four markets analyzed. Assuming now more than current Level 2 charging infrastructure (6.6 kW) the annual net profit for the Th!nk City fleet is from US{\$} 7000 to 70,000 providing regulation down only. For the RAV4 fleet the annual net profit ranges from US{\$} 24,000 to 260,000 providing regulation down and up. Vehicle-to-grid power could provide a significant revenue stream that would improve the economics of grid-connected electric-drive vehicles and further encourage their adoption. It would also improve the stability of the electrical grid. © 2007.},

This work seeks to better understand an important piece of information that has been missing from these discussions: what do power interruptions and fluctuations in power quality (power-quality events) cost electricity consumers? We developed a bottom-up approach for assessing the cost to US electricity consumers of power interruptions and power-quality events (referred to collectively as "reliability events"). The approach can be used to help assess the potential benefits of investments in improving the reliability of the grid. We developed a new estimate based on publicly available information, and assessed how uncertainties in these data affect this estimate using sensitivity analysis. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In electrical islands, frequency excursions are sizeable and automatic load shedding is often required in response to disturbances. Moreover, the displacement of conventional generation with wind and solar plants, which usually do not provide inertial response, further weakens these power systems. Fast-acting storage, by injecting power within instants after the loss of a generating unit, can back up conventional generation assets during the activation of their primary reserve. This paper relies on dynamic simulations to study the provision of such a dynamic frequency control support by energy storage systems in the French island of Guadeloupe with large shares of wind or solar generation. The results show that fast-acting storage, by acting as a synthetic inertia, can mitigate the impact of these sources on the dynamic performance of the studied island grid in the case of a major generation outage. The other concerns raised by renewables (e.g., variability, forecast accuracy, low voltage ride-through, etc.) have not been addressed within this project.},

In parallel, some loads also have PV generation capability. We postulate that the inverters associated with each PV system are also capable of limited reactive power generation or consumption, and we seek to find the optimal dispatch of each inverter's reactive power to both maintain the voltage within an acceptable range and minimize the resistive losses over the entire circuit. We assume the complex impedance of the distribution circuit links and the instantaneous load and PV generation at each load are known. We compare the results of the optimal dispatch with a suboptimal local scheme that does not require any communication. On our model distribution circuit, we illustrate the feasibility of high levels of PV penetration and a significant (20{\%} or higher) reduction in losses.},

abstract = {Electric energy storage is probably the first viable for households since they pay the highest electricity tariffs, being a factor four higher than bulk electricity prices. The attractiveness depends on the subsidy systems (if existing), the electricity price and the purchase cost of a PV installation and a battery system. Since the electricity price may not remain constant during the lifetime of the storage system, a financial cash flow calculation is needed including discount rate and inflation. In this research the optimal PV-battery system is determined as a function of the remuneration (discerning a subsidised region, a "market" price region and no fees at all), the investment year (2012, 2017 and 2021) and the electricity price increase rate (0{\%}, 4{\%}, 6{\%}) (including the general inflation rate). The analysis is based on available battery energy storage systems on the market and on real household measurement data. All these degrees of freedom secure the accuracy of the analysis. The article shows also the battery throughput cost with a direct comparison to the electricity cost. It becomes clear that batteries can already be cost-effective today without subsidies and irrespective of the electricity price increase, but without a return on investment if the electricity price does not increase more than the inflation. An investor cannot recommend batteries today. However, if the electricity price increases with 4{\%} than batteries become quickly attractive and do not need subsidies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Unlike markets for storable commodities, electricity markets depend on the real-time balance of supply and demand. Although much of the present-day grid operates effectively without storage, cost-effective ways of storing electrical energy can help make the grid more efficient and reliable. We investigate the economics of two emerging electric energy storage (EES) technologies: sodium sulfur batteries and flywheel energy storage systems in New York state's electricity market. The analysis indicates that there is a strong economic case for EES installations in the New York City region for applications such as energy arbitrage, and that significant opportunities exist throughout New York state for regulation services. Benefits from deferral of system upgrades may be important in the decision to deploy EES. Market barriers currently make it difficult for energy-limited EES such as flywheels to receive revenue for voltage regulation. Charging efficiency is more important to the economics of EES in a competitive electricity market than has generally been recognized. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Since the main problem of continuous energy supply from photovoltaic (PV) power plant is intermittence and inability to provide continuous energy supply, this paper proposes its hybridization with hydro energy, or with pump storage hydroelectric (PSH) as a possible solution. This creates a new type of sustainable hybrid power plant which can work continuously, using solar energy as primary energy source and water for energy storage. The characteristics of the solution as an open thermodynamic system are presented, as well as the basic theoretical settings for its application, i.e. key relationships between power and collector field area of PV power plant and working volume of upper storage. The paper introduces hydrological and hydro-energetic indicators for the hybrid plant description, "artificial rainfall", as the relationship between the water pumped into the upper water storage of the PSH (artificial water inflow) and collector field area of the PV power plant, as well as hydroenergy potential. The proposed hybrid electric power plant does not emit greenhouse gases, produce waste or significantly exploit water resources while the risks to humans and the environment are far smaller than when using conventional technology. This solution is flexible for implementation and can be applied in various climates, hydrological and physical conditions. It is especially productive in cases of joint use of solar and hydro energy where they naturally complement each other as natural energy sources in the annual working cycle. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The paper considers a rule-based control scheme, which is the solution of the optimal control problem defined, to incorporate the operating constraints of the BESS, such as state of charge limits, charge/discharge current limits, and lifetime. The goal of the control is to have the BESS provide as much smoothing as possible so that the renewable resource can be dispatched on an hourly basis based on the forecasted solar/wind conditions. The effectiveness of this control strategy has been tested by using an actual PV system and wind farm data and it is shown that the BESS can indeed help to cope with variability in wind's and solar's generation.},

abstract = {Recently we reported that PV penetration of up to approximately 90{\%} of the annual demand of the Israeli electricity grid could be achieved using properly sized storage and an appropriate operation strategy. Such a grid clearly requires some conventional generating capacity to be available in order to serve as backup at times when the PV-storage combination alone fails to meet the demand. In the present continuation of that study, we evaluate the largest conventional capacity that would have been required during the one year of data employed for our simulations. For that year, 2006, the required backup capacity for a grid with flexibility ff=0.8 and ff=1 would have been 7.5. GW and 6.6. GW, respectively. This is significantly less than the 10.5. GW of generating capacity that the Israel Electric Corporation operated that year. Our finding emphasizes the fact that a full economic optimization of storage must be based primarily on the engineering-aspects of storage design and use. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Most recent improvements in battery and electric vehicle (EV) technologies, combined with some favorable off-peak charging rates and an enormous PV potential, make California a prime market for electric vehicle as well as stationary storage adoption. However, EVs or plug-in hybrids, which can be seen as a mobile energy storage, connected to different buildings throughout the day, constitute distributed energy resources (DER) markets and can compete with stationary storage, onsite energy production (e.g. fuel cells, PV) at different building sites. Sometimes mobile storage is seen linked to renewable energy generation (e.g. PV) or as resource for the wider macro-grid by providing ancillary services for grid-stabilization. In contrast, this work takes a fundamentally different approach and considers buildings as the main hub for EVs/plug-in hybrids and considers them as additional resources for a building energy management system (EMS) to enable demand response or any other building strategy (e.g. carbon dioxide reduction). To examine the effect of, especially, electric storage technologies on building energy costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, a distributed-energy resources adoption problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program with minimization of annual building energy costs or CO2 emissions. The mixed-integer linear program is applied to a set of 139 different commercial building types in California, and the aggregated economic and environmental benefits are reported. To show the robustness of the results, different scenarios for battery performance parameters are analyzed. The results show that the number of EVs connected to the California commercial buildings depend mostly on the optimization strategy (cost versus CO2) of the building EMS and not on the battery performance parameters. The complexity of the DER interactions at buildings also show that a reduction in stationary battery costs increases the local PV adoption, but can also increase the fossil based onsite electricity generation, making an holistic optimization approach necessary for this kind of analyses.},

This kind of plant is aiming to overcome some of the major limitations of renewable energy sources, represented by their low power density and intermittent nature, largely depending upon local site and unpredictable weather conditions. In CAES, energy is stored in the form of compressed air in a reservoir during off-peak periods, while it is used on demand during peak periods to generate power with a turbo-generator system. Such plants can offer significant benefits in terms of flexibility in matching a fluctuating power demand, particularly when coupled with renewable sources, characterized by high and often unpredictable variability. A mathematical model, validated in a previous study over the CAES plant in Alabama, US, is coupled with a dynamic programming algorithm to achieve the optimal management of the plant, in order to minimize operational costs while satisfying constraints related to the operation of reservoir, compressors and turbines, also considering their off-design performance. The potential benefits of such plant in terms of energy consumption and CO2 emission are analyzed and discussed, for different configurations and scenarios. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

It was discovered that over the past 5-10 years, the hot weather peak load has extended from 3??pm to 6??pm and that a more northwesterly orientation of solar panels is of assistance. It was also found that wind is of little assistance in hot weather peaks, in contrast to data for the NSW central tablelands region; however solar contributes at least 50{\%} of its nominal peak capacity. As hot weather peaks are now extending into the early evening, it was found that storage would be of great benefit and would enhance the use of renewable energy sources.

The power output of sources like wind and solar varies with time and location due to factors that cannot be controlled by the provider. Two strategies have been proposed to hedge against this variability: 1) use energy storage systems to effectively average the produced power over time; 2) exploit distributed generation to effectively average production over location. We introduce a network model to study the optimal use of storage and transmission resources in the presence of random energy sources. We propose a Linear-Quadratic based methodology to design control strategies, and show that these strategies are asymptotically optimal for some simple network topologies. For these topologies, the dependence of optimal performance on storage and transmission capacity is explicitly quantified.},

As a partial solution to the problem, this paper proposes the installation of a properly managed, wind-powered, pumped hydro energy storage system (PHES) on the island of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands). Results from a dynamic model of the island's power system show that the installation of a pumped storage system is fully supported in all circumstances. They also show that the level of wind penetration in the network can be increased. These results have been obtained assuming that two of the largest existing reservoirs on the island (with a difference in altitude of 281 m and a capacity of aprox. 5,000,000 m 3 each) are used as storage reservoirs with three 54 MW generators. Likewise, the ability of such facilities to contribute to the stability of the system is shown. This type of installation can reduce fossil fuel consumption, reducing CO 2 emissions. Moreover, not only can the PHES improve wind penetration level, but it also allows the number of wind farms installed to be increased. Regions with geographically suitable sites and energy problems similar to those on the Canary Islands are encouraged to analyze the technical and economic feasibility of installing similar power systems to the one in this paper. Such systems have an enormous, unexplored potential within the general guiding framework of policies promoting clean, renewable energy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@techreport{Hanley2008,
abstract = {In late 2007, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) initiated a series of studies to address issues related to potential high penetration of distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation systems on our nation’s electric grid. This Renewable Systems Interconnection (RSI) initiative resulted in the publication of 14 reports and an Executive Summary that defined needs in areas related to utility planning tools and business models, new grid architectures and PV systems configurations, and models to assess market penetration and the effects of high-penetration PV systems. As a result of this effort, the Solar Energy Grid Integration Systems (SEGIS) program was initiated in early 2008. SEGIS is an industry-led effort to develop new PV inverters, controllers, and energy management systems that will greatly enhance the utility of distributed PV systems. This paper describes the concept for augmenting the SEGIS Program with energy storage in residential and small commercial (≤100 kW) applications. Integrating storage with SEGIS in these applications can facilitate increased penetration of distributed PV systems by providing increased value to both customers and utilities. Depending on the application, the systems can reduce customers’ utility bills, provide outage protection, and protect equipment on the load side from the negative effects of voltage fluctuations on the grid. With sufficient penetration, PV-Storage systems are expected to reduce emissions related to generation and will be critical to maintaining overall power quality and grid reliability as grid-tied distributed PV generation becomes more common. Although electric energy storage is a well-established market, its use in PV systems is generally for stand-alone systems. The goal of SEGIS Energy Storage (SEGIS-ES) Programis to develop electric energy storage components and systems specifically designed and optimized for grid-tied PV applications. The Program will accomplish this by conducting targeted research and development (R{\&}D) on the applications most likely to benefit from a PV-Storage system (i.e., peak shaving, load shifting, demand response, outage protection, and microgrids) and developing PV-Storage technologies specifically designed to meet those needs. Designing optimized systems based on existing storage technologies will require comprehensive knowledge of the applications and the available storage technologies as well as modeling tools that can accurately simulate the economic and operational effect of a PV- Storage system used in that application. This paper describes the scope of the proposed SEGIS-ES Program; why it will be necessary to integrate energy storage with PV systems as PV-generated energy becomes more prevalent on the nation’s utility grid; and the applications for which energy storage is most suited and for which it will provide the greatest economic and operational benefits to customers and utilities. Because selecting and optimizing the storage technology for the application will be critical to the success of any PV-Storage system, this paper also provides a detailed summary of the various storage technologies and compares their relative costs and development status (e.g., mature, emerging, etc.). Finally, the paper highlights the areas where further, PV- specific R{\&}D is needed and offers recommendations as to how proceed with the proposed work.},

abstract = {Electricity generated from renewable sources, which has shown remarkable growth worldwide, can rarely provide immediate response to demand as these sources do not deliver a regular supply easily adjustable to consumption needs. Thus, the growth of this decentralized production means greater network load stability problems and requires energy storage, generally using lead batteries, as a potential solution. However, lead batteries cannot withstand high cycling rates, nor can they store large amounts of energy in a small volume. That is why other types of storage technologies are being developed and implemented. This has led to the emergence of storage as a crucial element in the management of energy from renewable sources, allowing energy to be released into the grid during peak hours when it is more valuable. The work described in this paper highlights the need to store energy in order to strengthen power networks and maintain load levels. There are various types of storage methods, some of which are already in use, while others are still in development. We have taken a look at the main characteristics of the different electricity storage techniques and their field of application (permanent or portable, long- or short-term storage, maximum power required, etc.). These characteristics will serve to make comparisons in order to determine the most appropriate technique for each type of application. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Since the main problem of continuous energy supply from photovoltaic (PV) power plant is intermittence and inability to provide continuous energy supply, this paper proposes its hybridization with hydro energy, or with pump storage hydroelectric (PSH) as a possible solution. This creates a new type of sustainable hybrid power plant which can work continuously, using solar energy as primary energy source and water for energy storage. The characteristics of the solution as an open thermodynamic system are presented, as well as the basic theoretical settings for its application, i.e. key relationships between power and collector field area of PV power plant and working volume of upper storage. The paper introduces hydrological and hydro-energetic indicators for the hybrid plant description, "artificial rainfall", as the relationship between the water pumped into the upper water storage of the PSH (artificial water inflow) and collector field area of the PV power plant, as well as hydroenergy potential. The proposed hybrid electric power plant does not emit greenhouse gases, produce waste or significantly exploit water resources while the risks to humans and the environment are far smaller than when using conventional technology. This solution is flexible for implementation and can be applied in various climates, hydrological and physical conditions. It is especially productive in cases of joint use of solar and hydro energy where they naturally complement each other as natural energy sources in the annual working cycle. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

With rapid development of electric energy storage (EES) technologies, there is a growing interest in integrating both EES and RER into power systems to improve their reliability and economy. In this paper, the adequacy and economy of distribution systems integrated with both EES and RER are assessed. A novel model predictive control (MPC)-based operation strategy is presented to minimize distribution system energy purchasing cost by coordinating multiple power supplies from EES, RER and external grid. An islanding operation is implemented to improve the distribution system reliability and reduce customer interruption cost. A reliability and economy assessment framework based on sequential Monte Carlo method integrated with the MPC-based operation and islanding operation is proposed. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate the reliability and economy improvement by implementing the proposed operation strategies together with integration of EES and RER, and also investigate how EES capacity, power limit, and wind turbine generation capacity affect system reliability and economy.

abstract = {This study investigates the economics of a wind power farm with a long-term market perspective, considering high shares of wind energy, constraints set on the energy variability, and the removal of support schemes such as feed-in tariffs. The contractual agreement with a compressed air energy storage facility (CAES) would create a hybrid wind-storage system that would allow a wind power operator to reduce the intermittency of its output and to provide flexibility to the system. The study gives a market value to the wind power at a project level of several gigawatts capacity located in France, by using a technical and economic optimization model. Results indicate the cost of balancing the intermittency for the wind operator and show that under baseline conditions, the hybrid wind-storage system would have negative profits despite price arbitrage operations and ancillary services provided to the system. Alternative tests show that the economics can improve when the influence of the wind power on the spot price is accounted for. The study is focused on the long term market situation in France, which is characterized by increased balancing needs, an ageing infrastructure, uncertainties in carbon and gas prices, and increased power imports. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Future sustainable energy systems call for the introduction of integrated storage technologies. One of these technologies is compressed air energy storage (CAES). In Denmark at present, wind power meets 20{\%} and combined heat and power production (CHP) meets 50{\%} of the electricity demand. Based on these figures, the paper assesses the value of integrating CAES into future sustainable energy systems with even higher shares of fluctuating renewable energy sources. The evaluation is made on the basis of detailed energy system analyses in which the supply of complete national energy systems is calculated hour by hour in relation to the demands during a year. The Danish case is evaluated in a system-economic perspective by comparing the economic benefits achieved by improving the integration of wind power to the costs of the CAES technology. The result is compared to various other storage options. Furthermore, a business-economic evaluation is done by calculating the potential income of the CAES technology from both spot markets and regulating power markets. The evaluation includes both historical hour by hour prices during a 7-year period on the Nordic Nord Pool market as well as expected future price variations. The conclusion is that even in energy systems with very high shares of wind power and CHP, neither the historical nor the expected future price variations on the spot market alone can justify the investment in CAES systems. Other storage technology options are significantly more feasible. CAES may operate both on the spot market and the regulating power market, which indicates potential feasibility. However, such strategy is highly risky because of the small extent of the regulating power market and if CAES is to become feasible it will depend on incomes from auxiliary services. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {To examine the potential benefits of energy storage in the electric grid, a generalized unit commitment model of thermal generating units and energy storage facilities is developed. Three different storage scenarios were tested-two without limits to total storage assignment and one with a constrained maximum storage portfolio. Given a generation fleet based on the City of Austin's renewable energy deployment plans, results from the unlimited energy storage deployment scenarios studied show that if capital costs are ignored, large quantities of seasonal storage are preferred. This operational approach enables storage of plentiful wind generation during winter months that can then be dispatched during high cost peak periods in the summer. These two scenarios yielded {\$}70 million and {\$}94 million in yearly operational cost savings but would cost hundreds of billions to implement. Conversely, yearly cost reductions of {\$}40 million can be achieved with one compressed air energy storage facility and a small set of electrochemical storage devices totaling 13 GWh of capacity. Similarly sized storage fleets with capital costs, service lifetimes, and financing consistent with these operational cost savings can yield significant operational benefit by avoiding dispatch of expensive peaking generators and improving utilization of renewable generation throughout the year. Further study using a modified unit commitment model can help to clarify optimal storage portfolios, reveal appropriate market participation approaches, and determine the optimal siting of storage within the grid.

abstract = {A Smart Grid demonstration project is currently underway at Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM). The project combines both residential and commercial loads on a dedicated feeder, with high PV penetration ratio, equipped with a 0.5MW substation-sited photovoltaic (PV) system and large-scale utility storage. The unique aspect of the battery storage system being used, is that both slow (load-shifting) and fast (intermittency-mitigation) power discharge modes are possible. Smart meters and customer Demand Response (DR) management, along with some customer-owned storage will all be implemented. This program targets a minimum of 15{\%} peak-load reduction at a specific feeder through a combination of these the devices and measures. In this paper, we present goals, future plans and current results of modeling for the existing and future infrastructure of this Smart Grid project.},

abstract = {In this paper, the unit commitment and dispatch of a power system with and without a pumped storage unit is examined for increasing levels of installed wind power, from 17{\%} of total energy to 80{\%} of total energy generated by wind 3 (3GW to 15GW of installed wind on the Irish system in 2020). At high levels of installed wind, it is shown that storage reduces curtailment and increases the use the base loaded plant on the system. This reduces system costs. However, when the additional capital costs of storage are taken into account, it is shown that storage is not viable from a system perspective until extremely large levels of wind power are seen on the system. At these levels of installed wind, while the system can operate without storage, it is less costly to do so with storage. The capacity credit of the storage unit is also examined, using a simplified approach, and shown to decrease as larger amounts of intermittent wind power are added to the system.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the minimum energy capacity ratings that an energy-storage (ES) system should accomplish in order to achieve a defined constant power production in a photovoltaic (PV) power plant. ES is a key issue for the further integration of intermittent and stochastic renewable energy sources, which are not currently dispatchable due to their dependence on real-time weather conditions, as is the case of PV technology. This paper proposes and describes an energy management strategy (EMS) for operating PV power plants with ES in the future. The goal of this EMS is to endow these power plants with a constant production that can be controlled and hence traded on electricity markets. This paper presents simulated results on the percentage of time throughout the year during which a large-scale PV+ES plant operates properly with different ES ratings and according to different configurations of this EMS. Finally, a test bench was developed, and experimental results validating this EMS were obtained.},

abstract = {In this work, we examine the potential advantages of co-locating wind and energy storage to increase transmission utilization and decrease transmission costs. Co-location of wind and storage decreases transmission requirements, but also decreases the economic value of energy storage compared to locating energy storage at the load. This represents a tradeoff which we examine to estimate the transmission costs required to justify moving storage from load-sited to wind-sited in three different locations in the United States. We examined compressed air energy storage (CAES) in three "wind by wire" scenarios with a variety of transmission and CAES sizes relative to a given amount of wind. In the sites and years evaluated, the optimal amount of transmission ranges from 60{\%} to 100{\%} of the wind farm rating, with the optimal amount of CAES equal to 0-35{\%} of the wind farm rating, depending heavily on wind resource, value of electricity in the local market, and the cost of natural gas. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

@techreport{Pullinger2011,
abstract = {Hydropower is the most widely adopted form of renewable energy in the world today, accounting for approximately 16$\backslash${\%} of global energy production ?1?. With increasing demand for electricity, and concern about reducing fossil fuel consumption, hydropower is likely to continue to play a key role in global energy production. The interest in pumped-storage systems is increasing, due to their ability to regulate power grids, increase the efficiency of thermal power (coal and nuclear), and maximise the penetration of renewable energy such as wind and solar. Since pumped-storage systems must respond quickly to load variations, transient flow phenomena are frequent. In the design of hydropower systems, transient effects are an important consideration, as rapid flow variations can lead to potentially catastrophic increases in pressure (water-hammer). Numerical techniques for hydraulic transient analysis appear to be well understood, but the hydraulic characteristics of reversible pump-turbines can create difficulties depending on the software used for the analysis. The ?S? shape of the machine characteristic in the turbine runaway region is a cause of instability in real machines and a potential cause of numerical instability in incorrectly designed or unsuitable software packages. The commercial hydraulic analysis software package SIMSEN-Hydro was used to evaluate hydraulic transients in two systems. Project A is a 25.5 MW run of river system utilising three Francis turbines. Hydraulic transients in the system were successfully modelled, and the results showed good agreement with load rejection data measured on site during commissioning of the project. Project B is a 1333 MW pumped-storage system utilising four reversible Francis pump-turbines. The machine curves include the characteristic ?S? shape in the runaway region of the turbine zone. Using SIMSEN-Hydro, the transients in the system were modelled, utilising the machine characteristics. Results were similar to those obtained during preliminary design of the system. By undertaking a sensitivity analysis for Project B, the effect of modifying input parameters on the simulation results was highlighted. The choice of pipe friction factor, surge tank throttling coefficient and generator inertia all had a notable effect on the results of the analysis. While the range of pressure wave-speeds that were examined did not have a significant effect on the results, this may differ for other systems. Based on these results, it seems important that sensitivity analysis be included on all transient analysis projects, unless the modelling inputs are all known with a reasonable level of accuracy.},

abstract = {In electrical islands, frequency excursions are sizeable and automatic load shedding is often required in response to disturbances. Moreover, the displacement of conventional generation with wind and solar plants, which usually do not provide inertial response, further weakens these power systems. Fast-acting storage, by injecting power within instants after the loss of a generating unit, can back up conventional generation assets during the activation of their primary reserve. This paper relies on dynamic simulations to study the provision of such a dynamic frequency control support by energy storage systems in the French island of Guadeloupe with large shares of wind or solar generation. The results show that fast-acting storage, by acting as a synthetic inertia, can mitigate the impact of these sources on the dynamic performance of the studied island grid in the case of a major generation outage. The other concerns raised by renewables (e.g., variability, forecast accuracy, low voltage ride-through, etc.) have not been addressed within this project.},

Data from real renewable plants has been used to explore in big electric systems (Spain) the optimal sizing of said storage systems.

abstract = {Electric energy storage is probably the first viable for households since they pay the highest electricity tariffs, being a factor four higher than bulk electricity prices. The attractiveness depends on the subsidy systems (if existing), the electricity price and the purchase cost of a PV installation and a battery system. Since the electricity price may not remain constant during the lifetime of the storage system, a financial cash flow calculation is needed including discount rate and inflation. In this research the optimal PV-battery system is determined as a function of the remuneration (discerning a subsidised region, a "market" price region and no fees at all), the investment year (2012, 2017 and 2021) and the electricity price increase rate (0{\%}, 4{\%}, 6{\%}) (including the general inflation rate). The analysis is based on available battery energy storage systems on the market and on real household measurement data. All these degrees of freedom secure the accuracy of the analysis. The article shows also the battery throughput cost with a direct comparison to the electricity cost. It becomes clear that batteries can already be cost-effective today without subsidies and irrespective of the electricity price increase, but without a return on investment if the electricity price does not increase more than the inflation. An investor cannot recommend batteries today. However, if the electricity price increases with 4{\%} than batteries become quickly attractive and do not need subsidies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

A new strategy should be applied in the coming decades based on the integration of existing power plants with renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy. Hybridization of existing power plants with solar energy is one proven option to overcome the problems of pollution and increasing fuel prices. In this paper, a review of the previous studies and papers for integrating solar thermal energy with conventional and non-conventional power plants was carried out. The focus on hybrid solar conventional power plants includes: the review of studies of hybrid solar-steam cycle power plants, integrated solar combined-cycle systems (ISCCS) and hybrid solar-gas turbine power plants, while for hybrid solar non-conventional power plants the focus of study is hybrid solar-geothermal power plants. The most successful option is ISCCS due to their advantages and the plans for implementation at various power plants in the world like in Tunisia, Egypt, Spain, and Iran. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Wind power generation is growing rapidly in many locations around the world. Power systems are able to absorb large amounts of wind capacity, but operational problems arise when the wind power penetration becomes high. Such factors as voltage dips, frequency variations, low power system stability, low reactive power and power flow imbalances reduce the economic value and represent a barrier to the unlimited development of wind energy. Hydrogen production from wind power that is not matched with hourly electricity demand appears to be an attractive storage option capable of providing a balancing service to the electricity generators and suppliers for mitigation of the negative impacts due to the random nature of wind. Because of its multi-functionality, hydrogen can be used directly as a fuel, mixed with methane, or transmitted through pipelines to the users. The aim of this paper is to produce useful suggestions for the planning, development and sizing of wind-hydrogen systems by taking into account the local and regional resources, demands, constraints and opportunities. This study considers both the economic and technological variables and describes an optimisation method (OM) for analysing power systems in which part of the electricity generated by a grid-connected wind plant is used to produce hydrogen by electrolysis. An example application of this OM has been developed for a specific geographical area located in central Sicily. Our results identify the potential and the limitations connected to cases that use excess wind power to produce hydrogen for civil applications. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Wind energy systems have been considered for Canada's remote communities in order to reduce their costs and dependence on diesel fuel to generate electricity. Given the high capital costs, low-penetration wind-diesel systems have been typically found not to be economic. High-penetration wind-diesel systems have the benefit of increased economies of scale, and displacing significant amounts of diesel fuel, but have the disadvantage of not being able to capture all of the electricity that is generated when the wind turbines operate at rated capacity. Two representative models of typical remote Canadian communities were created using HOMER, an NREL micro-power simulator to model how a generic energy storage system could help improve the economics of a high-penetration wind-diesel system. Key variables that affect the optimum system are average annual wind speed, cost of diesel fuel, installed cost of storage and a storage systems overall efficiency. At an avoided cost of diesel fuel of 0.30 {\$}Cdn/kWh and current installed costs, wind generators are suitable in remote Canadian communities only when an average annual wind speed of at least 6.0 m/s is present. Wind energy storage systems become viable to consider when average annual wind speeds approach 7.0 m/s, if the installed cost of the storage system is less than 1000 {\$}Cdn/kW and it is capable of achieving at least a 75{\%} overall energy conversion efficiency. In such cases, energy storage system can enable an additional 50{\%} of electricity from wind turbines to be delivered. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For example, photovoltaic cells and small wind turbines can be coupled with energy storage systems such as batteries. Used effectively, battery storage can increase the versatility of a micro-generation system by satisfying the highly variable electrical load of an individual dwelling, therefore changing usage patterns on the national grid (Jenkins et al 2008). In addition, a significant shift towards electric or hybrid cars would also increase the number of batteries required. However, batteries can be inefficient and comprise of materials that have high environmental and energy impacts. In addition, some materials, such as lithium, are scarce natural resources. As a result, the overall impact of increasing our reliance on such “sustainable” systems may in fact have an additional detrimental impact. This paper outlines previous work in this area, and reviews the data available about battery production and use in terms of their life cycle environmental and energy impacts. Problems associated with resource availability are also highlighted.

abstract = {Integrating large amounts of wind power in energy systems poses balancing challenges due to the variable and only partly predictable nature of wind. The challenges cover different time scales from intra-hour, intra-day to several days and seasonal level. Various flexibility measures are being discussed as candidates for contributing to large-scale wind power integration and these also differ in terms of the time scales at which they can operate. In this paper, using the case of West Denmark in 2025 with an expected 57 {\%} wind power penetration, wind power impacts on different time scales are analysed. Results show consecutive negative and high net load period lengths indicating a potential for flexible technologies capable of charging/activating demand and discharging/inactivating demand in periods of one hour to around half a day, providing intra-day balancing. The analysis also suggests a potential for flexible technologies responding to high/low net load periods of lengths approaching one day to several days, providing intra-week/s balancing. In addition, the results indicate a physical potential for seasonal balancing. In the study, battery electric vehicles, small heat pumps in individual hourses, large heat pumps and electric boilers in district heating grids, which are all considered promising technologies for wind power integration, are moreover categorized with respect to the time scales at which they will typically be suited for this purpose. While all of the technologies are found suited for providing intra-hour and intra-day balancing, only large heat pumps and electric boilers are assessed suited for providing balancing intra-week. If combined with large seasonal thermal storages, large heat pumps and electric boilers could also provide flexibility across months.},

abstract = {In this work, we examine the potential advantages of co-locating wind and energy storage to increase transmission utilization and decrease transmission costs. Co-location of wind and storage decreases transmission requirements, but also decreases the economic value of energy storage compared to locating energy storage at the load. This represents a tradeoff which we examine to estimate the transmission costs required to justify moving storage from load-sited to wind-sited in three different locations in the United States. We examined compressed air energy storage (CAES) in three "wind by wire" scenarios with a variety of transmission and CAES sizes relative to a given amount of wind. In the sites and years evaluated, the optimal amount of transmission ranges from 60{\%} to 100{\%} of the wind farm rating, with the optimal amount of CAES equal to 0-35{\%} of the wind farm rating, depending heavily on wind resource, value of electricity in the local market, and the cost of natural gas. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The compressed air energy storage (CAES) system is a mature and reliable bulk energy storage technique with promising potential to accommodate high wind power penetration in power systems. This paper proposes an optimization model to decide the rated power and capacity of a CAES system, which is crucial to maximizing economical profits. This methodology involves several steps. Firstly, the constraints of the CAES system’s rated power are considered, which include the CAES system’s compensation for power shortages during peak load period, the influence of the operation on power flow and the impact on the system when CAES is switched. Secondly, an exponential distribution is adopted to calculate wind power curtailment at night, based on which the benefits from recovering wind power curtailment can be estimated. Finally, the economical profits are optimized according to the CAES investment cost, operation cost and turnout. The results show that the proposed methodology can provide a referential guidance for CAES sizing according to different situations in practice.},

abstract = {A model for thermo-economic analysis and optimization of a hybrid power plant consisting of compressed air energy storage (CAES) coupled with a wind farm and a photovoltaic plant is presented. This kind of plant is aiming to overcome some of the major limitations of renewable energy sources, represented by their low power density and intermittent nature, largely depending upon local site and unpredictable weather conditions. In CAES, energy is stored in the form of compressed air in a reservoir during off-peak periods, while it is used on demand during peak periods to generate power with a turbo-generator system. Such plants can offer significant benefits in terms of flexibility in matching a fluctuating power demand, particularly when coupled with renewable sources, characterized by high and often unpredictable variability. A mathematical model, validated in a previous study over the CAES plant in Alabama, US, is coupled with a dynamic programming algorithm to achieve the optimal management of the plant, in order to minimize operational costs while satisfying constraints related to the operation of reservoir, compressors and turbines, also considering their off-design performance. The potential benefits of such plant in terms of energy consumption and CO2 emission are analyzed and discussed, for different configurations and scenarios. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Integrating large amounts of wind power in energy systems poses balancing challenges due to the variable and only partly predictable nature of wind. The challenges cover different time scales from intra-hour, intra-day to several days and seasonal level. Various flexibility measures are being discussed as candidates for contributing to large-scale wind power integration and these also differ in terms of the time scales at which they can operate. In this paper, using the case of West Denmark in 2025 with an expected 57 {\%} wind power penetration, wind power impacts on different time scales are analysed. Results show consecutive negative and high net load period lengths indicating a potential for flexible technologies capable of charging/activating demand and discharging/inactivating demand in periods of one hour to around half a day, providing intra-day balancing. The analysis also suggests a potential for flexible technologies responding to high/low net load periods of lengths approaching one day to several days, providing intra-week/s balancing. In addition, the results indicate a physical potential for seasonal balancing. In the study, battery electric vehicles, small heat pumps in individual hourses, large heat pumps and electric boilers in district heating grids, which are all considered promising technologies for wind power integration, are moreover categorized with respect to the time scales at which they will typically be suited for this purpose. While all of the technologies are found suited for providing intra-hour and intra-day balancing, only large heat pumps and electric boilers are assessed suited for providing balancing intra-week. If combined with large seasonal thermal storages, large heat pumps and electric boilers could also provide flexibility across months.},

abstract = {One economic disincentive to investing in wind generation is that the average market value of wind energy can be lower than that of other generation technologies. This is driven by the exercise of market power by other generators and the fact that the ability of these generators to exercise market power is inversely related to real-time wind availability. We examine the use of energy storage to mitigate this price suppression by shifting wind generation from periods with low prices to periods with higher prices. We show that storage can significantly increase the value of wind generation but the currently high capital cost of storage technologies cannot be justified on the basis of this use. Moreover, we demonstrate that this use of storage can reduce consumer surplus, the profits of other non-wind generators, and social welfare. We also examine the sensitivity of these effects to a number of parameters including storage size, storage efficiency, ownership structure, and market competitiveness--showing that a more-competitive market can make storage significantly more valuable to a wind generator.

In particular, the variability of wind source does not allow for accurate forecasting of power generation. Production plans may not be accomplished, incurring penalties for system unbalance. For this reason, the use of an energy storage system can improve integration of wind energy in production planning and dispatch. In this paper, an approach for planning and operating an energy storage system for a wind farm in the electricity market is proposed. To this purpose, electrochemical batteries are employed to compensate for generation variations in order to set up a reliable hourly delivery profile, complying with market requirements. The delivery plan can be settled according to energy prices, as well. Moreover, an economic feasibility analysis is carried out on the combined wind-storage system.},

This paper summarizes the existing contribution of DR resources in U.S. electric power markets. In 2008, customers enrolled in existing wholesale and retail DR programs were capable of providing ???38,000 MW of potential peak load reductions in the United States. Participants in organized wholesale market DR programs, though, have historically overestimated their likely performance during declared curtailments events, but appear to be getting better as they and their agents gain experience. In places with less developed organized wholesale market DR programs, utilities are learning how to create more flexible DR resources by adapting legacy load management programs to fit into existing wholesale market constructs. Overall, the development of open and organized wholesale markets coupled with direct policy support by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has facilitated new entry by curtailment service providers, which has likely expanded the demand response industry and led to product and service innovation. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Both renewable and nuclear energy can provide significant contributions to decarbonizing the electric sector. However, a grid employing large amounts of wind and solar energy requires the balance of the system to be highly flexible to respond to the increased variability of the net load. This makes deployment of conventional nuclear power challenging both due to the technical challenges of plant cycling and economic limits of reduced capacity factor. In the United States nuclear power plants generally provide constant, base load power and are most economic when operated at constant power levels. Operating nuclear power plants in load-following modes decreases the plants' annual energy output and increases the levelized cost of energy, decreasing economic competitiveness. One possible solution is to couple thermal energy storage to nuclear power plants. This would enable the reactor to remain at nearly constant output, while cycling the electrical generator in response to the variability of the net load. This paper conceptually explores combinations of wind, solar, and nuclear that can provide a large fraction of a system's electricity, assuming the use of thermal energy storage that would allow nuclear power to provide load following and cycling duty while operating at a constant reactor power output. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {We study the strategic utilization of storage in imperfect electricity markets. We apply a game-theoretic Cournot model to the German power market and analyze different counterfactual and realistic cases of pumped hydro storage. Our main finding is that both storage utilization and storage-related welfare effects depend on storage ownership and the operator's involvement in conventional generation. Strategic operators generally under-utilize owned storage capacity. Strategic storage operation may also lead to welfare losses, in particular if the total storage capacity is controlled by an oligopolistic generator that also owns conventional generation capacity. Yet in the current German situation, pumped hydro storage is not a relevant source of market power. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {We examine the potential economic implications of using vehicle batteries to store grid electricity generated at off-peak hours for off-vehicle use during peak hours. Ancillary services such as frequency regulation are not considered here because only a small number of vehicles will saturate that market. Hourly electricity prices in three U.S. cities were used to arrive at daily profit values, while the economic losses associated with battery degradation were calculated based on data collected from A123 Systems LiFePO4/Graphite cells tested under combined driving and off-vehicle electricity utilization. For a 16 kWh (57.6 MJ) vehicle battery pack, the maximum annual profit with perfect market information and no battery degradation cost ranged from ???US{\$}140 to {\$}250 in the three cities. If the measured battery degradation is applied, however, the maximum annual profit (if battery pack replacement costs fall to {\$}5000 for a 16 kWh battery) decreases to ???{\$}10-120. It appears unlikely that these profits alone will provide sufficient incentive to the vehicle owner to use the battery pack for electricity storage and later off-vehicle use. We also estimate grid net social welfare benefits from avoiding the construction and use of peaking generators that may accrue to the owner, finding that these are similar in magnitude to the energy arbitrage profit. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Large scale penetration of renewable energies such as wind and solar into the electric grid is complicated by their intermittency. Energy storage systems can mitigate these fluctuations by storing off-peak energy for use at peak-demand times. Compressed air energy storage (CAES) is one of the most promising storage technologies due to the large amount of energy that can be stored at an economical cost. We evaluate the feasibility of improving the economics of CAES by distributing compressors near heat loads to enable recovery of the heat of compression to supply low-grade heating needs such as district heating. Distributed CAES (DCAES) is more efficient; however, it has higher capital costs due to the compressed air pipeline required between distributed compressors and the storage site. We evaluate the project economics of DCAES in a hypothetical scenario with a variable electric and heat load. The size and dispatch of a generation fleet composed of a wind farm, CAES or DCAES plant and conventional gas turbines are optimized to satisfy the annual electricity load at an hourly resolution at the lowest total cost. We find that the total cost of supplying heat and electric loads is less expensive with DCAES given a 50. km pipeline when fuel prices exceed {\$}7.6/GJ. The cross-over fuel price depends on the distance as it drives the capital cost of the pipeline. The minimum effective fuel price required for economic superiority of the DCAES system is {\$}7.0/GJ and {\$}8.3/GJ at pipeline lengths of 25 and 100. km, respectively. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Promoting renewable energy has been a key ingredient in energy policy seeking to de-carbonize the energy mix and will continue to do so in the future given the European Union's high ambitions to further curb carbon emissions. A wide range of instruments has been suggested and implemented in various countries of the EU. A prominent policy promoting investment in renewable technologies is the use of feed-in tariffs, which has worked well at large scale in, e.g. Germany, but which has only been implemented in a very limited way in countries such as the UK. Being subject to environmental uncertainties, however, renewables cannot be seen in isolation: while renewables-based technologies such as wind and solar energy, for example, suffer from uncertain loads depending on environmental conditions, hydropower allows for the storage of water for release at peak prices, which can be treated as a premium (partially) offsetting higher upfront investment costs. In addition, electricity prices will respond to changes in electric capacity in the market, which is often neglected in standard investment models of the electricity sector. This paper contributes to the existing literature in two ways: it provides a review of a renewables-based technology in a specific policy context and provides additional insight by employing a real options approach to investigate the specific characteristics of renewables and their associated uncertainties in a stylized setting taking explicitly into account market effects of investment decisions. The prices of the model are determined endogenously by the supply of electricity in the market and by exogenous electricity price uncertainty. The inclusion of market effects allows us to capture the full impact of public incentives for companies to invest into wind power and hydro pumped storage installations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Electricity as a commodity is markedly different from other commodities in the sense that it must, in general, be consumed when it is produced. The capability to store energy for a later use can help to improve the flexibility of power system operation by providing control of power as and when required. With a strong push towards increasing the reliance on renewable energy resources, a flexible power system is desired; one that can accommodate increased variability and uncertainty of generating resources. Energy storage is one strategy for enhancing the flexibility of power system operation. The application for energy storage can be broadly classified into energy applications (bulk transfer of energy from one time to another) and power applications (fast injection/absorption of power). There is also a broad spectrum between energy and power applications. The selection of a storage system as a means of adding flexibility to the grid depends upon a number of factors: cost being an important one. Other strategies that can offer flexibility in today's power system include demand response and fast-start generation with high ramping potential.},

abstract = {This study analyzes power storage as a key option to support wind energy integration. The case study is the French power system, whose characteristics rely on high rates of nuclear power and a strong emerging wind energy market. A dynamic optimization dispatching model is used to simulate the operation of the power system, under two development scenarios of the technology mix by 2030, one scenario documented by European Commission, EC [1], and a second one by French Transmission System Operator, RTE [2]. Both scenarios result in power storage requirements of around 7 TWh for more than 4 GW installed storage capacity of pumped hydro power plants in France as a whole. In this context, it is assessed the profitability of an additional regional project of Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) located in the region of Bretagne. It shows how benefits could accrue by avoiding the regional wind curtailment of 59 GWh, by providing ancillary services such as secondary reserve, and by increasing the use of grid assets and the nuclear power output with more than 230 GWh. The profitability of the CAES project remains however negative, around -70 /MWh despite the social value and the system benefits that results in. The study assesses qualitatively possible ways to incentivize the investment in new storage projects, through for instance contracts for difference, which would link the storage operation, its investment cost and stage of development to the power market design via power prices and a pre-defined rate of return. The periodical revision of these regulatory arrangements would enable the storage investor to recover the investment cost and would eliminate the risk of over rewarding generators in the case of windfall profits. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper considers a rule-based control scheme, which is the solution of the optimal control problem defined, to incorporate the operating constraints of the BESS, such as state of charge limits, charge/discharge current limits, and lifetime. The goal of the control is to have the BESS provide as much smoothing as possible so that the renewable resource can be dispatched on an hourly basis based on the forecasted solar/wind conditions. The effectiveness of this control strategy has been tested by using an actual PV system and wind farm data and it is shown that the BESS can indeed help to cope with variability in wind's and solar's generation.},

abstract = {A fundamental truth of the electrical grid has been, in general, that electricity must be generated at the precise moment it is demanded. It is the ultimate {\&}{\#}x0022;just-in-time{\&}{\#}x0022; system, required by the laws of physics to carry no inventory. This characterization is again under challenge, as development of grid scale energy storage devices, both electrochemical and mechanical, is accelerating and being represented as a critical piece of the grid infrastructure of the future. Much of the impetus behind this activity follows closely with the early days of meaningfully high penetrations of renewable generation into our power systems, at both the transmission and distribution-level; each of which presents somewhat different challenges in terms of integrating wind and solar energy. Storage, it is argued, offers the stabilization and buffering capacity that will be necessary to reconcile the variability of growing amounts of renewable generation and the challenges these might cause with relatively predictable and stable loads. Our purpose in this paper is to introduce a few frameworks for consideration of both the necessity of grid scale energy storage for the reliable operation of the grid of the future as well as the economic propositions that these assets will face in developed electricity markets and under established utility practices. Simply put, there are three basic and obvious questions that must be addressed for any asset deployment: (1) what is the problem the asset will solve?; (2) what is the mechanism by which an investor would be able to recover the costs of the asset?; and (3) what other means are there of solving the same problem? This paper will consider each of these questions for a variety of applications of utility-scale energy storage.},

Although much of the present-day grid operates effectively without storage, cost-effective ways of storing electrical energy can help make the grid more efficient and reliable. We investigate the economics of two emerging electric energy storage (EES) technologies: sodium sulfur batteries and flywheel energy storage systems in New York state's electricity market. The analysis indicates that there is a strong economic case for EES installations in the New York City region for applications such as energy arbitrage, and that significant opportunities exist throughout New York state for regulation services. Benefits from deferral of system upgrades may be important in the decision to deploy EES. Market barriers currently make it difficult for energy-limited EES such as flywheels to receive revenue for voltage regulation. Charging efficiency is more important to the economics of EES in a competitive electricity market than has generally been recognized. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Integration of energy storage systems into the Smart Grid can manage the real power variability of wind generation by providing ramp rate variation control and frequency regulation via droop control response. These control features drastically increase reliability of the Smart Grid, enables more effective grid management. Operational issues raised by the variability and high ramping characteristics of wind generation can be mitigated with the integration of battery energy storage systems. This paper presents several control methodologies for battery energy storage systems. Results are discussed particularly with respect to developing better insight into the dynamic performance of such resources and how to manage problems associated with the viability in real power output of wind generation.},

abstract = {Both renewable and nuclear energy can provide significant contributions to decarbonizing the electric sector. However, a grid employing large amounts of wind and solar energy requires the balance of the system to be highly flexible to respond to the increased variability of the net load. This makes deployment of conventional nuclear power challenging both due to the technical challenges of plant cycling and economic limits of reduced capacity factor. In the United States nuclear power plants generally provide constant, base load power and are most economic when operated at constant power levels. Operating nuclear power plants in load-following modes decreases the plants' annual energy output and increases the levelized cost of energy, decreasing economic competitiveness. One possible solution is to couple thermal energy storage to nuclear power plants. This would enable the reactor to remain at nearly constant output, while cycling the electrical generator in response to the variability of the net load. This paper conceptually explores combinations of wind, solar, and nuclear that can provide a large fraction of a system's electricity, assuming the use of thermal energy storage that would allow nuclear power to provide load following and cycling duty while operating at a constant reactor power output. ?? 2012.},

The innovation in the work is the use of historical wind data series and wind forecasts to derive a management strategy for the operation of large PHES using stochastic optimization that outperforms current methods in power systems with significant wind generation.

abstract = {Electricity storage is considered as a valuable source of flexibility with applications covering the whole electricity value chain. Most of the existing evaluation methods for electricity storage are conceived for one specific use of the storage, which often leads to the conclusion that the investment on storage does not pay off. However, the value of storage cannot be properly estimated without taking into account the possibility of aggregating the services that storage can offer to different actors. This paper proposes a new business model that allows aggregating multiple revenue streams of electricity storage in a systematic way. The model consists in coordinating a series of auctions in which the right to utilize the storage unit is auctioned upon different time horizons. In the mean time, non-conflicting usage of storage by the actors in these different auctions is ensured. The functioning of the model is demonstrated by a case study. The results show that a storage unit can achieve higher return on investment in the manner proposed in the business model. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The growing economy with corresponding increase in power demand causes more challenges in power sector of developing countries. In India, the increase in peak power demand necessitates energy storage schemes over and above the storage - hydro-, oil- and gas-based peak power plants to ensure power system stability. In utility energy storage schemes, the Pumped storage schemes attract more attention even in the developed countries due to its unique operational flexibility over other energy storage systems. In India, the availability of suitable topographies, hydro-thermal ratio imbalance in various regions, and optimal storage capacity for flexible power system operation gives a thought for the planers and executors to implement these schemes to meet peak demands. This paper presents a critical review of the necessity of pumped storage schemes in India. This review reveals that the major constraint for pumped storage operation in India is the deficit of off-peak power available in all the regional grids except north-east region for pumping at present. But the current adversity is likely to be gradually solved by the commissioning of newly proposed power projects. Fixing of a separate operational tariff for pumped storage schemes throughout the country is another requirement for which the government has set up a one man committee to analyze the feasibility for this peak tariff. Non-availability of lower tail pools and irrigation needs also causes poor pumping operations in some cases. However, most of the states in India are evincing interest in pumped storage schemes and proposals are being submitted to central government for securing stations clearance. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Mitigation of the variability in output power of renewable generators such as solar photovoltaic (PV) systems is a growing concern as these generators reach higher penetrations on electric grids. Furthermore, increased penetration of electric vehicle (EV) loads presents a challenge for distribution feeders. This paper presents a system where a bidirectional, highly efficient, dc-dc EV charger is placed between the high-voltage dc bus of a PV inverter and the EV battery. The system partially alleviates feeder overloading by providing fast charging for the EV battery from the PV system. In addition, the charger is capable of diverting fast changes in PV power output to the battery, thereby reducing the rate of change of inverter output power to a level below the ramp rate of existing grid resources. The paper addresses sizing of the charger and energy storage based on the PV system rating, the desired maximum ramp rate, and site solar irradiation characteristics, including geographic dispersion of PV arrays. Analysis suggests that small amounts of energy storage can accomplish large reductions in output power ramp rate. Experimental results are shown for a 10 kW, 98{\%} efficient dc-dc charger based on bidirectional four-phase zero-voltage-switching converter.},

abstract = {Most recent improvements in battery and electric vehicle (EV) technologies, combined with some favorable off-peak charging rates and an enormous PV potential, make California a prime market for electric vehicle as well as stationary storage adoption. However, EVs or plug-in hybrids, which can be seen as a mobile energy storage, connected to different buildings throughout the day, constitute distributed energy resources (DER) markets and can compete with stationary storage, onsite energy production (e.g. fuel cells, PV) at different building sites. Sometimes mobile storage is seen linked to renewable energy generation (e.g. PV) or as resource for the wider macro-grid by providing ancillary services for grid-stabilization. In contrast, this work takes a fundamentally different approach and considers buildings as the main hub for EVs/plug-in hybrids and considers them as additional resources for a building energy management system (EMS) to enable demand response or any other building strategy (e.g. carbon dioxide reduction). To examine the effect of, especially, electric storage technologies on building energy costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, a distributed-energy resources adoption problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program with minimization of annual building energy costs or CO2 emissions. The mixed-integer linear program is applied to a set of 139 different commercial building types in California, and the aggregated economic and environmental benefits are reported. To show the robustness of the results, different scenarios for battery performance parameters are analyzed. The results show that the number of EVs connected to the California commercial buildings depend mostly on the optimization strategy (cost versus CO2) of the building EMS and not on the battery performance parameters. The complexity of the DER interactions at buildings also show that a reduction in stationary battery costs increases the local PV adoption, but can also increase the fossil based onsite electricity generation, making an holistic optimization approach necessary for this kind of analyses.},

abstract = {As large-scale photovoltaic (PV) generation reaches higher penetration levels, there is a greater need to meet the certain grid code requirements for interconnection. Ultracapacitor, battery energy storage system (BESS) or shunt capacitor have recently been used as auxiliary devices for large-scale PV generator system to meet the grid code requirements for interconnection. Although the individual auxiliary devices are well documented, a comparative study of these devices impact on the damping of electromechanical (EM) modes and oscillatory instability problem has not been reported so far. This paper aims to fill in the gap, and provides a comparative analysis of these auxiliary devices performance along with PV plant on the damping of EM modes. The oscillation problem is analyzed by considering different types of synchronous generator (e.g. hydro, thermal) as the non-electrical components of hydro and thermal units have major influences on system dynamics.

abstract = {The economic viability of producing baseload wind energy was explored using a cost-optimization model to simulate two competing systems: wind energy supplemented by simple- and combined cycle natural gas turbines ("wind+gas"), and wind energy supplemented by compressed air energy storage ("wind+CAES"). Pure combined cycle natural gas turbines ("gas") were used as a proxy for conventional baseload generation. Long-distance electric transmission was integral to the analysis. Given the future uncertainty in both natural gas price and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions price, we introduced an effective fuel price, pNGeff, being the sum of the real natural gas price and the GHG price. Under the assumption of pNGeff={\$}5/GJ (lower heating value), 650 W/m2 wind resource, 750 km transmission line, and a fixed 90{\%} capacity factor, wind+CAES was the most expensive system at ??6.0/kWh, and did not break even with the next most expensive wind+gas system until pNGeff={\$}9.0/GJ. However, under real market conditions, the system with the least dispatch cost (short-run marginal cost) is dispatched first, attaining the highest capacity factor and diminishing the capacity factors of competitors, raising their total cost. We estimate that the wind+CAES system, with a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rate that is one-fourth of that for natural gas combined cycle plants and about one-tenth of that for pulverized coal plants, has the lowest dispatch cost of the alternatives considered (lower even than for coal power plants) above a GHG emissions price of {\$}35/tCequiv., with good prospects for realizing a higher capacity factor and a lower total cost of energy than all the competing technologies over a wide range of effective fuel costs. This ability to compete in economic dispatch greatly boosts the market penetration potential of wind energy and suggests a substantial growth opportunity for natural gas in providing baseload power via wind+CAES, even at high natural gas prices. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants in organized wholesale market DR programs, though, have historically overestimated their likely performance during declared curtailments events, but appear to be getting better as they and their agents gain experience. In places with less developed organized wholesale market DR programs, utilities are learning how to create more flexible DR resources by adapting legacy load management programs to fit into existing wholesale market constructs.

We apply a game-theoretic Cournot model to the German power market and analyze different counterfactual and realistic cases of pumped hydro storage. Our main finding is that both storage utilization and storage-related welfare effects depend on storage ownership and the operator's involvement in conventional generation. Strategic operators generally under-utilize owned storage capacity. Strategic storage operation may also lead to welfare losses, in particular if the total storage capacity is controlled by an oligopolistic generator that also owns conventional generation capacity.

abstract = {Electricity as a commodity is markedly different from other commodities in the sense that it must, in general, be consumed when it is produced. The capability to store energy for a later use can help to improve the flexibility of power system operation by providing control of power as and when required. With a strong push towards increasing the reliance on renewable energy resources, a flexible power system is desired; one that can accommodate increased variability and uncertainty of generating resources. Energy storage is one strategy for enhancing the flexibility of power system operation. The application for energy storage can be broadly classified into energy applications (bulk transfer of energy from one time to another) and power applications (fast injection/absorption of power). There is also a broad spectrum between energy and power applications. The selection of a storage system as a means of adding flexibility to the grid depends upon a number of factors: cost being an important one. Other strategies that can offer flexibility in today's power system include demand response and fast-start generation with high ramping potential.},

abstract = {Solar thermal power plants are usually installed in locations with high yearly average solar radiation, often deserts. In such conditions, cooling water required for thermodynamic cycles is rarely available. Moreover, when solar radiation is high, ambient temperature is very high as well; this leads to excessive condensation temperature, especially when air-condensers are used, and decreases the plant efficiency. However, temperature variation in deserts is often very high, which drives to relatively low temperatures during the night. This fact can be exploited with the use of a closed cooling system, so that the coolant (water) is chilled during the night and store. Chilled water is then used during peak temperature hours to cool the condenser (dry cooling), thus enhancing power output and efficiency. The present work analyzes the performance improvement achieved by night thermal cool storage, compared to its equivalent air cooled power plant. Dry cooling is proved to be energy-effective for moderately high day-night temperature differences (20 °C), often found in desert locations. The storage volume requirement for different power plant efficiencies has also been studied, resulting on an asymptotic tendency. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this work, we present a storage-based wind power smoothing system that uses novel optimization algorithms to reduce the variability of wind energy. The system considers forecasted and actual energy generated, battery size, and energy prices and determines export rates that have low variability and maximize either the energy exported or revenue earned. Our optimization algorithms are novel as they model an equivalent relaxed buffer system that uses only linear constraints and allows the computation of optimal smoothing solutions in an efficient manner. This enables the system to be used in an online manner in real time as well as in planning and operations. The smoothing system and the mathematical models and programs used in optimization are presented along with preliminary simulation results that demonstrate the need and effectiveness of the system with the help of real wind energy data. Finally, we compare wind smoothing to video smoothing and point out the important similarities and differences.},

abstract = {One economic disincentive to investing in wind generation is that the average market value of wind energy can be lower than that of other generation technologies. This is driven by the exercise of market power by other generators and the fact that the ability of these generators to exercise market power is inversely related to real-time wind availability. We examine the use of energy storage to mitigate this price suppression by shifting wind generation from periods with low prices to periods with higher prices. We show that storage can significantly increase the value of wind generation but the currently high capital cost of storage technologies cannot be justified on the basis of this use. Moreover, we demonstrate that this use of storage can reduce consumer surplus, the profits of other non-wind generators, and social welfare. We also examine the sensitivity of these effects to a number of parameters including storage size, storage efficiency, ownership structure, and market competitiveness--showing that a more-competitive market can make storage significantly more valuable to a wind generator.

abstract = {Renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, have vast potential to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions in the electric sector. Climate change concerns, state initiatives including renewable portfolio standards, and consumer efforts are resulting in increased deployments of both technologies. Both solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind energy have variable and uncertain (sometimes referred to as intermittent) output, which are unlike the dispatchable sources used for the majority of electricity generation in the United States. The variability of these sources has led to concerns regarding the reliability of an electric grid that derives a large fraction of its energy from these sources as well as the cost of reliably integrating large amounts of variable generation into the electric grid. In this report, we explore the role of energy storage in the electricity grid, focusing on the effects of large-scale deployment of variable renewable sources (primarily wind and solar energy).},

abstract = {We investigate the economic viability of coupling a wind farm with compressed air energy storage (CAES) to participate in the day-ahead electricity market at a time when renewable portfolio standards are not binding and wind competes freely in the marketplace. In our model, the CAES is used to reduce the risk of committing uncertain quantities of wind energy and to shift dispatch of wind generation to high price periods. Other sources of revenue (capacity markets, ancillary services, price arbitrage) are not included in the analysis. We present a model to calculate profit maximizing day-ahead dispatch schedules based on wind forecasts. Annual profits are determined with dispatch schedules and actual wind generation values. We find that annual income for the modeled wind–CAES system would not cover annualized capital costs using market prices from the years 2006 to 2009. We also estimate market prices with a carbon price of {\$}20 and {\$}50 per tonne CO2 and find that revenue would still not cover the capital costs. The implied cost per tonne of avoided CO2 to make a wind–CAES profitable from trading on the day-ahead market is roughly {\$}100, with large variability due to electric power prices.},

Because both are intermittent, any infinite busbar grid supplying a metropolitan area must necessarily be buffered from these intermittencies by massive energy storage on the gigawatt-day level. It is then demonstrated that, under presently foreseeable scientific capabilities, only underground pumped hydro and advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage appear capable of meeting anticipated technological and economic constraints.

The modernization of the existing grid requires the implementation of controls and communication architecture that are capable of coordinating as available resources such as wind generation, energy storage and loads in order to improve the efficient and economic operation of the electric power distribution system. Integration of energy storage systems into the Smart Grid can manage the real power variability of wind generation by providing ramp rate variation control and frequency regulation via droop control response. These control features drastically increase reliability of the Smart Grid, enables more effective grid management. Operational issues raised by the variability and high ramping characteristics of wind generation can be mitigated with the integration of battery energy storage systems. This paper presents several control methodologies for battery energy storage systems. Results are discussed particularly with respect to developing better insight into the dynamic performance of such resources and how to manage problems associated with the viability in real power output of wind generation.},

abstract = {Electric-drive vehicles can provide power to the electric grid when they are parked (vehicle-to-grid power). We evaluated the economic potential of two utility-owned fleets of battery-electric vehicles to provide power for a specific electricity market, regulation, in four US regional regulation services markets. The two battery-electric fleet cases are: (a) 100 Th!nk City vehicle and (b) 252 Toyota RAV4. Important variables are: (a) the market value of regulation services, (b) the power capacity (kW) of the electrical connections and wiring, and (c) the energy capacity (kWh) of the vehicle's battery. With a few exceptions when the annual market value of regulation was low, we find that vehicle-to-grid power for regulation services is profitable across all four markets analyzed. Assuming now more than current Level 2 charging infrastructure (6.6 kW) the annual net profit for the Th!nk City fleet is from US{\$} 7000 to 70,000 providing regulation down only. For the RAV4 fleet the annual net profit ranges from US{\$} 24,000 to 260,000 providing regulation down and up. Vehicle-to-grid power could provide a significant revenue stream that would improve the economics of grid-connected electric-drive vehicles and further encourage their adoption. It would also improve the stability of the electrical grid. © 2007.},

@techreport{Hanley2008,
abstract = {In late 2007, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) initiated a series of studies to address issues related to potential high penetration of distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation systems on our nation’s electric grid. This Renewable Systems Interconnection (RSI) initiative resulted in the publication of 14 reports and an Executive Summary that defined needs in areas related to utility planning tools and business models, new grid architectures and PV systems configurations, and models to assess market penetration and the effects of high-penetration PV systems. As a result of this effort, the Solar Energy Grid Integration Systems (SEGIS) program was initiated in early 2008. SEGIS is an industry-led effort to develop new PV inverters, controllers, and energy management systems that will greatly enhance the utility of distributed PV systems. This paper describes the concept for augmenting the SEGIS Program with energy storage in residential and small commercial (≤100 kW) applications. Integrating storage with SEGIS in these applications can facilitate increased penetration of distributed PV systems by providing increased value to both customers and utilities. Depending on the application, the systems can reduce customers’ utility bills, provide outage protection, and protect equipment on the load side from the negative effects of voltage fluctuations on the grid. With sufficient penetration, PV-Storage systems are expected to reduce emissions related to generation and will be critical to maintaining overall power quality and grid reliability as grid-tied distributed PV generation becomes more common. Although electric energy storage is a well-established market, its use in PV systems is generally for stand-alone systems. The goal of SEGIS Energy Storage (SEGIS-ES) Programis to develop electric energy storage components and systems specifically designed and optimized for grid-tied PV applications. The Program will accomplish this by conducting targeted research and development (R{\&}D) on the applications most likely to benefit from a PV-Storage system (i.e., peak shaving, load shifting, demand response, outage protection, and microgrids) and developing PV-Storage technologies specifically designed to meet those needs. Designing optimized systems based on existing storage technologies will require comprehensive knowledge of the applications and the available storage technologies as well as modeling tools that can accurately simulate the economic and operational effect of a PV- Storage system used in that application. This paper describes the scope of the proposed SEGIS-ES Program; why it will be necessary to integrate energy storage with PV systems as PV-generated energy becomes more prevalent on the nation’s utility grid; and the applications for which energy storage is most suited and for which it will provide the greatest economic and operational benefits to customers and utilities. Because selecting and optimizing the storage technology for the application will be critical to the success of any PV-Storage system, this paper also provides a detailed summary of the various storage technologies and compares their relative costs and development status (e.g., mature, emerging, etc.). Finally, the paper highlights the areas where further, PV- specific R{\&}D is needed and offers recommendations as to how proceed with the proposed work.},

Hence, the traditional methods of static dispatch are no longer suitable for microgrids. This paper proposes a dynamic economic dispatch method. Considering microgrid as a discrete time system, the dynamic economic dispatch is to find the optimal control strategy for the system in finite time period. Based on this idea, the dynamic economic dispatch model for microgrids is established, and then the corresponding dynamic programming algorithm is designed. Finally, an example of microgrid is given, and the dynamic economic dispatch results are compared with that of the static dispatch. The comparison confirms the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic dispatch method.},

abstract = {During 2005 approximately 2,500 MW of wind capacity was added in the United States, which brought installed wind capacity to about 9,150 MW. Although the total wind capacity in the United States is less than in some countries, wind energy has caught the attention of some utilities that depend on natural gas to generate power. There is evidence that wind development will continue at significant levels in the United States for the next several years, although it may be sensitive to a number of factors that include transmission availability, wind turbine availability, prices of wind technology and competing fuels, production tax credit availability, and states’ renewable portfolio standards (RPSs). This trend has helped induce electricity providers to investigate the potential impact of wind on the power system. Because of wind power’s unique characteristics, many concerns are based on the increased variability that wind contributes to the grid, and most U.S. studies have focused on this aspect of wind generation. Grid operators are also concerned about the ability to predict wind generation over several time scales. In this report we discuss some recent studies that have occurred in the United States since our previous work [2, 3]. The key objectives of these studies were to quantify the physical impacts and costs of wind generation on grid operations and the associated costs. Examples of these costs are (a) committing unneeded generation, (b) allocating more load- following capability to account for wind variability, and (c) allocating more regulation capacity. These are referred to as “ancillary service” costs, and are based on the physical system and operating characteristics and procedures. This topic is covered in more detail by Zavadil et al. [4].},

abstract = {This paper presents a simulation study based on actual load, sunshine and wind data. A distribution feeder simulation model was constructed using this data to determine what potential benefit embedded wind, solar and storage elements could give to the distribution network. The results were compared to earlier studies. It was discovered that over the past 5-10 years, the hot weather peak load has extended from 3??pm to 6??pm and that a more northwesterly orientation of solar panels is of assistance. It was also found that wind is of little assistance in hot weather peaks, in contrast to data for the NSW central tablelands region; however solar contributes at least 50{\%} of its nominal peak capacity. As hot weather peaks are now extending into the early evening, it was found that storage would be of great benefit and would enhance the use of renewable energy sources. As part of the feeder model, the optimal method of Var control from the embedded sources was also studied. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {One of the main characteristics of wind power is the inherent variability and uncontrollability. Even with state-of-the art forecasting techniques, actual wind generation can be substantially deviated from the forecasted values. In addition, the system load is also variable and needs to be forecasted ahead of time for unit commitment and system planning and operation purposes. Although daily loads follow a pattern, every forecast is associated with a certain degree of uncertainty. In a system consisting of only wind generation and load, with minimum or no connection to the grid, the task of energy balancing is extremely difficult. Incorporation of energy storage units is being considered as a possible solution to this problem. However, energy storage units till date are expensive. Hence the question that arises is, given a generation-load system, what is the optimal amount of storage required. This paper investigates the storage size required by a system consisting of a wind farm and a load in meeting certain specified reliability indices. The optimization model is formulated as a stochastic linear programming problem considering two random quantities, load and wind generation. The minimum initial energy required in the storage unit is also computed. The reliability index of the system is evaluated in terms of the LOLP (Loss of Load Probability). Another reliability index, SGP (Spilled Generation Probability), is defined to determine the probability of a wind energy spillage event due to excess wind generation that cannot be accommodated in the system. A realistic example case is presented where the developed methodology is tested with satisfactory results.},

While there are many papers covering the optimization of component size and dispatch strategy, far fewer papers contain experimental performance data from hybrid systems. Mercy Hospital in Bo, Sierra Leone is converting their power system into a photovoltaic (PV)-diesel hybrid system, thus providing an opportunity to examine the change in system performance before, during, and after the conversion. Due to the seasonal availability of electric power in Sierra Leone, two datasets representing two distinct load profiles are analyzed: Wet Season and Dry Season. The difference in generation efficiency,cost per kW h, generator runtime, and fuel consumption are calculated between a diesel-only generation baseline and the recorded hybrid system performance. The results indicated that the hybrid system significantly reduces operation costs; approximately 37{\%} less during Dry Season and 64{\%} reduction in the Wet Season than a diesel-only generator serving the same load. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The economic viability of producing baseload wind energy was explored using a cost-optimization model to simulate two competing systems: wind energy supplemented by simple- and combined cycle natural gas turbines ("wind+gas"), and wind energy supplemented by compressed air energy storage ("wind+CAES"). Pure combined cycle natural gas turbines ("gas") were used as a proxy for conventional baseload generation. Long-distance electric transmission was integral to the analysis. Given the future uncertainty in both natural gas price and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions price, we introduced an effective fuel price, pNGeff, being the sum of the real natural gas price and the GHG price. Under the assumption of pNGeff={\$}5/GJ (lower heating value), 650 W/m2 wind resource, 750 km transmission line, and a fixed 90{\%} capacity factor, wind+CAES was the most expensive system at ??6.0/kWh, and did not break even with the next most expensive wind+gas system until pNGeff={\$}9.0/GJ. However, under real market conditions, the system with the least dispatch cost (short-run marginal cost) is dispatched first, attaining the highest capacity factor and diminishing the capacity factors of competitors, raising their total cost. We estimate that the wind+CAES system, with a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rate that is one-fourth of that for natural gas combined cycle plants and about one-tenth of that for pulverized coal plants, has the lowest dispatch cost of the alternatives considered (lower even than for coal power plants) above a GHG emissions price of {\$}35/tCequiv., with good prospects for realizing a higher capacity factor and a lower total cost of energy than all the competing technologies over a wide range of effective fuel costs. This ability to compete in economic dispatch greatly boosts the market penetration potential of wind energy and suggests a substantial growth opportunity for natural gas in providing baseload power via wind+CAES, even at high natural gas prices. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study investigates two methods of transforming intermittent wind electricity into firm baseload capacity: (1) using electricity from natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) power plants and (2) using electricity from compressed air energy storage (CAES) power plants. The two wind models are compared in terms of capital and electricity costs, CO 2 emissions, and fuel consumption rates. The findings indicate that the combination of wind and NGCC power plants is the lowest-cost method of transforming wind electricity into firm baseload capacity power supply at current natural gas prices (∼{\$}6/GJ). However, the electricity supplied by wind and CAES power plants becomes economically competitive when the cost of natural gas for electric producers is {\$}10.55/GJ or greater. In addition, the Wind-CAES system has the lowest CO 2 emissions (93{\%} and 71{\%} lower than pulverized coal power plants and Wind-NGCC, respectively) and the lowest fuel consumption rates (9 and 4 times lower than pulverized coal power plants and Wind-NGCC, respectively). As such, the large-scale introduction of Wind-CAES systems in the U.S. appears to be the prudent long-term choice once natural gas price volatility, costs, and climate impacts are all considered. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Most of the existing evaluation methods for electricity storage are conceived for one specific use of the storage, which often leads to the conclusion that the investment on storage does not pay off. However, the value of storage cannot be properly estimated without taking into account the possibility of aggregating the services that storage can offer to different actors. This paper proposes a new business model that allows aggregating multiple revenue streams of electricity storage in a systematic way. The model consists in coordinating a series of auctions in which the right to utilize the storage unit is auctioned upon different time horizons. In the mean time, non-conflicting usage of storage by the actors in these different auctions is ensured. The functioning of the model is demonstrated by a case study. The results show that a storage unit can achieve higher return on investment in the manner proposed in the business model. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A significant number of islands have been forced to restrict the penetration level of renewable energy sources (RES) in their conventional electrical power systems. These limitations attempt to prevent problems that might affect the stability and security of the electrical system. Restrictions that may apply to the penetration of wind energy can also be an obstacle when meeting European Union renewable energy objectives. As a partial solution to the problem, this paper proposes the installation of a properly managed, wind-powered, pumped hydro energy storage system (PHES) on the island of Gran Canaria (Canary Islands). Results from a dynamic model of the island's power system show that the installation of a pumped storage system is fully supported in all circumstances. They also show that the level of wind penetration in the network can be increased. These results have been obtained assuming that two of the largest existing reservoirs on the island (with a difference in altitude of 281 m and a capacity of aprox. 5,000,000 m 3 each) are used as storage reservoirs with three 54 MW generators. Likewise, the ability of such facilities to contribute to the stability of the system is shown. This type of installation can reduce fossil fuel consumption, reducing CO 2 emissions. Moreover, not only can the PHES improve wind penetration level, but it also allows the number of wind farms installed to be increased. Regions with geographically suitable sites and energy problems similar to those on the Canary Islands are encouraged to analyze the technical and economic feasibility of installing similar power systems to the one in this paper. Such systems have an enormous, unexplored potential within the general guiding framework of policies promoting clean, renewable energy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

To this purpose, electrochemical batteries are employed to compensate for generation variations in order to set up a reliable hourly delivery profile, complying with market requirements.

Ancillary services such as frequency regulation are not considered here because only a small number of vehicles will saturate that market. Hourly electricity prices in three U.S. cities were used to arrive at daily profit values, while the economic losses associated with battery degradation were calculated based on data collected from A123 Systems LiFePO4/Graphite cells tested under combined driving and off-vehicle electricity utilization. For a 16 kWh (57.6 MJ) vehicle battery pack, the maximum annual profit with perfect market information and no battery degradation cost ranged from ???US{\$}140 to {\$}250 in the three cities. If the measured battery degradation is applied, however, the maximum annual profit (if battery pack replacement costs fall to {\$}5000 for a 16 kWh battery) decreases to ???{\$}10-120. It appears unlikely that these profits alone will provide sufficient incentive to the vehicle owner to use the battery pack for electricity storage and later off-vehicle use. We also estimate grid net social welfare benefits from avoiding the construction and use of peaking generators that may accrue to the owner, finding that these are similar in magnitude to the energy arbitrage profit. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

At high levels of installed wind, it is shown that storage reduces curtailment and increases the use the base loaded plant on the system. This reduces system costs. However, when the additional capital costs of storage are taken into account, it is shown that storage is not viable from a system perspective until extremely large levels of wind power are seen on the system. At these levels of installed wind, while the system can operate without storage, it is less costly to do so with storage. The capacity credit of the storage unit is also examined, using a simplified approach, and shown to decrease as larger amounts of intermittent wind power are added to the system.},

abstract = {Energy storage constitutes an effective way to manage excess RES production, and pumped storage is a suitable and mature solution for large storage capacities. The present study aims to investigate the performance of a pumped storage unit introduced in a conventional Hydroelectric Power Plant in Greece. At first, the plant operation and the electric grid data for a reference period of one year are used to compute the time variation of water inflow into the dam, and to estimate the RES production rejections depending on the installed power. Next, a pumping station powered by the rejected RES production and raising water from an adjacent downstream reservoir is modeled. Various scenarios concerning the pumping station power rate and feeding program are examined. The operation of the combined system is simulated in detail and the energy results are analyzed. Also, an economic evaluation is carried out based on current financial conditions in Greece. The results showed that a considerable amount of excess RES production can be stored, but the economic viability of the investment depends on some critical parameters, which are identified. Certain guidelines concerning the optimum sizing and operation strategy of the pumped storage scheme are finally extracted. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Future power grid systems are envisioned to be integrated with many distributed renewable energy sources (DRES). Energy storage is a key technology to enable reliable and cost-effective renewable energy. Given the fact that a large-scale energy storage device is usually costly to install and operate, we are naturally led to the following question: How much storage is necessary to guarantee the stability of a power grid network with DRESs? This paper represents a first step in systematically exploring the tradeoff between the capacity of energy storage devices and the outage probability, i.e., the probability of the occurrence of imbalance between the supply and demand. We first propose a secure scheduling and dispatch (SSD) algorithm that is capable of maintaining the grid stability in the presence of volatility in the power generation. We then derive a closed-form bound to quantify the tradeoff between the storage capacity and the outage probability. Under mild assumptions, we show that the outage probability decreases exponentially with respect to the square of the storage capacity. This finding implies that energy storage is an effective and economically viable solution to maintain the stability of a smart grid network, even in the presence of many volatile and intermittent renewable energy sources. The impact of correlation in energy generation on the stability of a smart grid network is also investigated .},

The optimal configuration for the electromechanical connection between the electrochemical batteries and flywheels is also considered in this study. Operational characteristics of the new storage systems were estimated and used in the simulations, while the financial aspects of the projects finalized using hand-made calculations and the HOMER software was used only for the energy calculations. It was found that an off-grid project using advanced and totally " green" technologies is possible and comparable to more conventional RES-based systems, in terms of energy and economical feasibility.

abstract = {The burning of depleting fossil fuels for power generation has detrimental impact on human life and climate. In view of this, renewable solar energy sources are being increasingly exploited to meet the energy needs. Moreover, solar photovoltaic (PV)-diesel hybrid system technology promises lot of opportunities in remote areas which are far from utility grid and are driven by diesel generators. Integration of PV systems with the diesel plants is being disseminated worldwide to reduce diesel fuel consumption and to minimize atmospheric pollution. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (K.S.A.) being endowed with high intensity of solar radiation, is a prospective candidate for deployment of PV systems. Also, K.S.A. has large number of remote scattered villages. The aim of this study is to analyze solar radiation data of Rafha, K.S.A., to assess the techno-economic feasibility of hybrid PV-diesel-battery power systems to meet the load requirements of a typical remote village Rawdhat Bin Habbas (RBH) with annual electrical energy demand of 15,943 MWh. Rafha is located near RBH. The monthly average daily global solar radiation ranges from 3.04 to 7.3 kWh/m2. NREL's HOMER software has been used to perform the techno-economic evaluation. The simulation results indicate that for a hybrid system composed of 2.5 MWp capacity PV system together with 4.5 MW diesel system (three 1.5 MW units) and a battery storage of 1 h of autonomy (equivalent to 1 h of average load), the PV penetration is 27{\%}. The cost of generating energy (COE, US{\$}/kWh) from the above hybrid system has been found to be 0.170{\$}/kWh (assuming diesel fuel price of 0.1{\$}/l). The study exhibits that the operational hours of diesel generators decrease with increase in PV capacity. The investigation also examines the effect of PV/battery penetration on COE, operational hours of diesel gensets. Concurrently, emphasis has been placed on: un-met load, excess electricity generation, percentage fuel savings and reduction in carbon emissions (for different scenarios such as: PV-diesel without storage, PV-diesel with storage, as compared to diesel-only situation), COE of different hybrid systems, etc. The decrease in carbon emissions by using the above hybrid system is about 24{\%} as compared to the diesel-only scenario. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Wind energy systems have been considered for Canada's remote communities in order to reduce their costs and dependence on diesel fuel to generate electricity. Given the high capital costs, low-penetration wind-diesel systems have been typically found not to be economic. High-penetration wind-diesel systems have the benefit of increased economies of scale, and displacing significant amounts of diesel fuel, but have the disadvantage of not being able to capture all of the electricity that is generated when the wind turbines operate at rated capacity. Two representative models of typical remote Canadian communities were created using HOMER, an NREL micro-power simulator to model how a generic energy storage system could help improve the economics of a high-penetration wind-diesel system. Key variables that affect the optimum system are average annual wind speed, cost of diesel fuel, installed cost of storage and a storage systems overall efficiency. At an avoided cost of diesel fuel of 0.30 {\$}Cdn/kWh and current installed costs, wind generators are suitable in remote Canadian communities only when an average annual wind speed of at least 6.0 m/s is present. Wind energy storage systems become viable to consider when average annual wind speeds approach 7.0 m/s, if the installed cost of the storage system is less than 1000 {\$}Cdn/kW and it is capable of achieving at least a 75{\%} overall energy conversion efficiency. In such cases, energy storage system can enable an additional 50{\%} of electricity from wind turbines to be delivered. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper reports on the findings from simulation software developed at Durham University that evaluates the benefits brought by operating an energy storage system in response to multiple events on multiple networks. The tool manages the allocation of a finite energy resource to achieve the most beneficial shared operation across two adjacent areas of distribution network. Simulations account for the key energy storage system parameters of capacity and power rating. Results for events requiring voltage control and power flow management show how the choice of operating strategy influences the benefits achieved.

abstract = {A fundamental truth of the electrical grid has been, in general, that electricity must be generated at the precise moment it is demanded. It is the ultimate {\&}{\#}x0022;just-in-time{\&}{\#}x0022; system, required by the laws of physics to carry no inventory. This characterization is again under challenge, as development of grid scale energy storage devices, both electrochemical and mechanical, is accelerating and being represented as a critical piece of the grid infrastructure of the future. Much of the impetus behind this activity follows closely with the early days of meaningfully high penetrations of renewable generation into our power systems, at both the transmission and distribution-level; each of which presents somewhat different challenges in terms of integrating wind and solar energy. Storage, it is argued, offers the stabilization and buffering capacity that will be necessary to reconcile the variability of growing amounts of renewable generation and the challenges these might cause with relatively predictable and stable loads. Our purpose in this paper is to introduce a few frameworks for consideration of both the necessity of grid scale energy storage for the reliable operation of the grid of the future as well as the economic propositions that these assets will face in developed electricity markets and under established utility practices. Simply put, there are three basic and obvious questions that must be addressed for any asset deployment: (1) what is the problem the asset will solve?; (2) what is the mechanism by which an investor would be able to recover the costs of the asset?; and (3) what other means are there of solving the same problem? This paper will consider each of these questions for a variety of applications of utility-scale energy storage.},

abstract = {Distribution level modeling or monitoring has not been of primary concerns of the utility companies so far, because traditionally the electric power is delivered unidirectional from distribution substations to the customers. Meanwhile, integrating Distributed Energy Resources (DER) into the distribution feeders and contribution of the customers in demand response and other aspects of the future smart grid is starting to push system planners, utility companies and researchers to build unabridged and detailed model of the distribution feeders even down to home appliances level. GridLAB-D{\&}{\#}x2122; and Open-DSS are both open source software tools, designed for modeling distribution level power systems. Design and development of multiple algorithms for peak shaving, arbitrage, load shifting and smoothing scenarios is of major concerns. We show that very promising results in terms of modeling future smart grid and various possibilities are expected.},

abstract = {Wind power generation is growing rapidly in many locations around the world. Power systems are able to absorb large amounts of wind capacity, but operational problems arise when the wind power penetration becomes high. Such factors as voltage dips, frequency variations, low power system stability, low reactive power and power flow imbalances reduce the economic value and represent a barrier to the unlimited development of wind energy. Hydrogen production from wind power that is not matched with hourly electricity demand appears to be an attractive storage option capable of providing a balancing service to the electricity generators and suppliers for mitigation of the negative impacts due to the random nature of wind. Because of its multi-functionality, hydrogen can be used directly as a fuel, mixed with methane, or transmitted through pipelines to the users. The aim of this paper is to produce useful suggestions for the planning, development and sizing of wind-hydrogen systems by taking into account the local and regional resources, demands, constraints and opportunities. This study considers both the economic and technological variables and describes an optimisation method (OM) for analysing power systems in which part of the electricity generated by a grid-connected wind plant is used to produce hydrogen by electrolysis. An example application of this OM has been developed for a specific geographical area located in central Sicily. Our results identify the potential and the limitations connected to cases that use excess wind power to produce hydrogen for civil applications. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

To follow the power demand is necessary controllable generation. The paper analyses based on hypothetical situations how to manage through storage systems the no-controllable productions to get the complete substitution of the no-renewable power plants. Data from real renewable plants has been used to explore in big electric systems (Spain) the optimal sizing of said storage systems.

The modernization of the existing grid requires the implementation of controls and communication architecture that are capable of coordinating as available resources such as wind generation, energy storage and loads in order to improve the efficient and economic operation of the electric power distribution system. Integration of energy storage systems into the Smart Grid can manage the real power variability of wind generation by providing ramp rate variation control and frequency regulation via droop control response. These control features drastically increase reliability of the Smart Grid, enables more effective grid management. Operational issues raised by the variability and high ramping characteristics of wind generation can be mitigated with the integration of battery energy storage systems. This paper presents several control methodologies for battery energy storage systems. Results are discussed particularly with respect to developing better insight into the dynamic performance of such resources and how to manage problems associated with the viability in real power output of wind generation.},

abstract = {A large fraction of new distributed generation will use renewable sources, and cannot be treated as conventional generators due to high variability. Energy storage is a natural mechanism for absorbing variability, and hence minimizing costly reliance on generator reserves. We consider a simple scenario in which energy imbalances are allocated to energy storage, representing either cooperation with a renewable producer or competitive operation in markets. The optimal storage scheduling strategy is shown to be an inventory control-like policy, which through mild approximation yields affine relationships with the state variables. We develop and numerically evaluate suboptimal policies that approximately incorporate the effects of correlation. Further approximation enables us to characterize the Nash equilibria arising between generation and storage, which we use to analyze strategic effects. Specifically, we find that inefficient storage can lead to non-socially optimal behavior.},

In this work, we present a storage-based wind power smoothing system that uses novel optimization algorithms to reduce the variability of wind energy. The system considers forecasted and actual energy generated, battery size, and energy prices and determines export rates that have low variability and maximize either the energy exported or revenue earned. Our optimization algorithms are novel as they model an equivalent relaxed buffer system that uses only linear constraints and allows the computation of optimal smoothing solutions in an efficient manner. This enables the system to be used in an online manner in real time as well as in planning and operations. The smoothing system and the mathematical models and programs used in optimization are presented along with preliminary simulation results that demonstrate the need and effectiveness of the system with the help of real wind energy data. Finally, we compare wind smoothing to video smoothing and point out the important similarities and differences.},

The tool manages the allocation of a finite energy resource to achieve the most beneficial shared operation across two adjacent areas of distribution network. Simulations account for the key energy storage system parameters of capacity and power rating.

abstract = {Future power grid systems are envisioned to be integrated with many distributed renewable energy sources (DRES). Energy storage is a key technology to enable reliable and cost-effective renewable energy. Given the fact that a large-scale energy storage device is usually costly to install and operate, we are naturally led to the following question: How much storage is necessary to guarantee the stability of a power grid network with DRESs? This paper represents a first step in systematically exploring the tradeoff between the capacity of energy storage devices and the outage probability, i.e., the probability of the occurrence of imbalance between the supply and demand. We first propose a secure scheduling and dispatch (SSD) algorithm that is capable of maintaining the grid stability in the presence of volatility in the power generation. We then derive a closed-form bound to quantify the tradeoff between the storage capacity and the outage probability. Under mild assumptions, we show that the outage probability decreases exponentially with respect to the square of the storage capacity. This finding implies that energy storage is an effective and economically viable solution to maintain the stability of a smart grid network, even in the presence of many volatile and intermittent renewable energy sources. The impact of correlation in energy generation on the stability of a smart grid network is also investigated .},

@techreport{Pullinger2011,
abstract = {Hydropower is the most widely adopted form of renewable energy in the world today, accounting for approximately 16$\backslash${\%} of global energy production ?1?. With increasing demand for electricity, and concern about reducing fossil fuel consumption, hydropower is likely to continue to play a key role in global energy production. The interest in pumped-storage systems is increasing, due to their ability to regulate power grids, increase the efficiency of thermal power (coal and nuclear), and maximise the penetration of renewable energy such as wind and solar. Since pumped-storage systems must respond quickly to load variations, transient flow phenomena are frequent. In the design of hydropower systems, transient effects are an important consideration, as rapid flow variations can lead to potentially catastrophic increases in pressure (water-hammer). Numerical techniques for hydraulic transient analysis appear to be well understood, but the hydraulic characteristics of reversible pump-turbines can create difficulties depending on the software used for the analysis. The ?S? shape of the machine characteristic in the turbine runaway region is a cause of instability in real machines and a potential cause of numerical instability in incorrectly designed or unsuitable software packages. The commercial hydraulic analysis software package SIMSEN-Hydro was used to evaluate hydraulic transients in two systems. Project A is a 25.5 MW run of river system utilising three Francis turbines. Hydraulic transients in the system were successfully modelled, and the results showed good agreement with load rejection data measured on site during commissioning of the project. Project B is a 1333 MW pumped-storage system utilising four reversible Francis pump-turbines. The machine curves include the characteristic ?S? shape in the runaway region of the turbine zone. Using SIMSEN-Hydro, the transients in the system were modelled, utilising the machine characteristics. Results were similar to those obtained during preliminary design of the system. By undertaking a sensitivity analysis for Project B, the effect of modifying input parameters on the simulation results was highlighted. The choice of pipe friction factor, surge tank throttling coefficient and generator inertia all had a notable effect on the results of the analysis. While the range of pressure wave-speeds that were examined did not have a significant effect on the results, this may differ for other systems. Based on these results, it seems important that sensitivity analysis be included on all transient analysis projects, unless the modelling inputs are all known with a reasonable level of accuracy.},

abstract = {Distribution level modeling or monitoring has not been of primary concerns of the utility companies so far, because traditionally the electric power is delivered unidirectional from distribution substations to the customers. Meanwhile, integrating Distributed Energy Resources (DER) into the distribution feeders and contribution of the customers in demand response and other aspects of the future smart grid is starting to push system planners, utility companies and researchers to build unabridged and detailed model of the distribution feeders even down to home appliances level. GridLAB-D{\&}{\#}x2122; and Open-DSS are both open source software tools, designed for modeling distribution level power systems. Design and development of multiple algorithms for peak shaving, arbitrage, load shifting and smoothing scenarios is of major concerns. We show that very promising results in terms of modeling future smart grid and various possibilities are expected.},

abstract = {Future sustainable energy systems call for the introduction of integrated storage technologies. One of these technologies is compressed air energy storage (CAES). In Denmark at present, wind power meets 20{\%} and combined heat and power production (CHP) meets 50{\%} of the electricity demand. Based on these figures, the paper assesses the value of integrating CAES into future sustainable energy systems with even higher shares of fluctuating renewable energy sources. The evaluation is made on the basis of detailed energy system analyses in which the supply of complete national energy systems is calculated hour by hour in relation to the demands during a year. The Danish case is evaluated in a system-economic perspective by comparing the economic benefits achieved by improving the integration of wind power to the costs of the CAES technology. The result is compared to various other storage options. Furthermore, a business-economic evaluation is done by calculating the potential income of the CAES technology from both spot markets and regulating power markets. The evaluation includes both historical hour by hour prices during a 7-year period on the Nordic Nord Pool market as well as expected future price variations. The conclusion is that even in energy systems with very high shares of wind power and CHP, neither the historical nor the expected future price variations on the spot market alone can justify the investment in CAES systems. Other storage technology options are significantly more feasible. CAES may operate both on the spot market and the regulating power market, which indicates potential feasibility. However, such strategy is highly risky because of the small extent of the regulating power market and if CAES is to become feasible it will depend on incomes from auxiliary services. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Mitigation of the variability in output power of renewable generators such as solar photovoltaic (PV) systems is a growing concern as these generators reach higher penetrations on electric grids. Furthermore, increased penetration of electric vehicle (EV) loads presents a challenge for distribution feeders. This paper presents a system where a bidirectional, highly efficient, dc-dc EV charger is placed between the high-voltage dc bus of a PV inverter and the EV battery. The system partially alleviates feeder overloading by providing fast charging for the EV battery from the PV system. In addition, the charger is capable of diverting fast changes in PV power output to the battery, thereby reducing the rate of change of inverter output power to a level below the ramp rate of existing grid resources. The paper addresses sizing of the charger and energy storage based on the PV system rating, the desired maximum ramp rate, and site solar irradiation characteristics, including geographic dispersion of PV arrays. Analysis suggests that small amounts of energy storage can accomplish large reductions in output power ramp rate. Experimental results are shown for a 10 kW, 98{\%} efficient dc-dc charger based on bidirectional four-phase zero-voltage-switching converter.},

@article{Parsons2006,
abstract = {During 2005 approximately 2,500 MW of wind capacity was added in the United States, which brought installed wind capacity to about 9,150 MW. Although the total wind capacity in the United States is less than in some countries, wind energy has caught the attention of some utilities that depend on natural gas to generate power. There is evidence that wind development will continue at significant levels in the United States for the next several years, although it may be sensitive to a number of factors that include transmission availability, wind turbine availability, prices of wind technology and competing fuels, production tax credit availability, and states’ renewable portfolio standards (RPSs). This trend has helped induce electricity providers to investigate the potential impact of wind on the power system. Because of wind power’s unique characteristics, many concerns are based on the increased variability that wind contributes to the grid, and most U.S. studies have focused on this aspect of wind generation. Grid operators are also concerned about the ability to predict wind generation over several time scales. In this report we discuss some recent studies that have occurred in the United States since our previous work [2, 3]. The key objectives of these studies were to quantify the physical impacts and costs of wind generation on grid operations and the associated costs. Examples of these costs are (a) committing unneeded generation, (b) allocating more load- following capability to account for wind variability, and (c) allocating more regulation capacity. These are referred to as “ancillary service” costs, and are based on the physical system and operating characteristics and procedures. This topic is covered in more detail by Zavadil et al. [4].},

Battery energy storage units are essential for microgrid operation, which make microgird become a strong coupling system in the time domain. Hence, the traditional methods of static dispatch are no longer suitable for microgrids. This paper proposes a dynamic economic dispatch method. Considering microgrid as a discrete time system, the dynamic economic dispatch is to find the optimal control strategy for the system in finite time period. Based on this idea, the dynamic economic dispatch model for microgrids is established, and then the corresponding dynamic programming algorithm is designed. Finally, an example of microgrid is given, and the dynamic economic dispatch results are compared with that of the static dispatch. The comparison confirms the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic dispatch method.},

@misc{Reuter2012,
abstract = {Promoting renewable energy has been a key ingredient in energy policy seeking to de-carbonize the energy mix and will continue to do so in the future given the European Union's high ambitions to further curb carbon emissions. A wide range of instruments has been suggested and implemented in various countries of the EU. A prominent policy promoting investment in renewable technologies is the use of feed-in tariffs, which has worked well at large scale in, e.g. Germany, but which has only been implemented in a very limited way in countries such as the UK. Being subject to environmental uncertainties, however, renewables cannot be seen in isolation: while renewables-based technologies such as wind and solar energy, for example, suffer from uncertain loads depending on environmental conditions, hydropower allows for the storage of water for release at peak prices, which can be treated as a premium (partially) offsetting higher upfront investment costs. In addition, electricity prices will respond to changes in electric capacity in the market, which is often neglected in standard investment models of the electricity sector. This paper contributes to the existing literature in two ways: it provides a review of a renewables-based technology in a specific policy context and provides additional insight by employing a real options approach to investigate the specific characteristics of renewables and their associated uncertainties in a stylized setting taking explicitly into account market effects of investment decisions. The prices of the model are determined endogenously by the supply of electricity in the market and by exogenous electricity price uncertainty. The inclusion of market effects allows us to capture the full impact of public incentives for companies to invest into wind power and hydro pumped storage installations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We investigate the economic viability of coupling a wind farm with compressed air energy storage (CAES) to participate in the day-ahead electricity market at a time when renewable portfolio standards are not binding and wind competes freely in the marketplace. In our model, the CAES is used to reduce the risk of committing uncertain quantities of wind energy and to shift dispatch of wind generation to high price periods. Other sources of revenue (capacity markets, ancillary services, price arbitrage) are not included in the analysis. We present a model to calculate profit maximizing day-ahead dispatch schedules based on wind forecasts. Annual profits are determined with dispatch schedules and actual wind generation values. We find that annual income for the modeled wind–CAES system would not cover annualized capital costs using market prices from the years 2006 to 2009. We also estimate market prices with a carbon price of {\$}20 and {\$}50 per tonne CO2 and find that revenue would still not cover the capital costs. The implied cost per tonne of avoided CO2 to make a wind–CAES profitable from trading on the day-ahead market is roughly {\$}100, with large variability due to electric power prices.},

abstract = {A large fraction of new distributed generation will use renewable sources, and cannot be treated as conventional generators due to high variability. Energy storage is a natural mechanism for absorbing variability, and hence minimizing costly reliance on generator reserves. We consider a simple scenario in which energy imbalances are allocated to energy storage, representing either cooperation with a renewable producer or competitive operation in markets. The optimal storage scheduling strategy is shown to be an inventory control-like policy, which through mild approximation yields affine relationships with the state variables. We develop and numerically evaluate suboptimal policies that approximately incorporate the effects of correlation. Further approximation enables us to characterize the Nash equilibria arising between generation and storage, which we use to analyze strategic effects. Specifically, we find that inefficient storage can lead to non-socially optimal behavior.},

The objective of this research was to identify the determinants of the in situ conservation of native chili varieties, including market participation. To this end,  128 farmers were surveyed in the Amazon rainforest region of Ucayali in Peru. The data were analyzed using probit, multinomial logit and truncated Poisson models with covariance matrix correction for cluster errors by rural community. Results suggest that participation in commercial agriculture statistically significantly increases the in situ conservation of native chili varieties; only when farmers sell their products to local retailers, but not when they supply wholesalers. In particular, this result implies that policies designed to encourage specific forms of market participation could have a positive effect on farmers’ economic well-being and simultaneously could help to achieve crop genetic diversity conservation goals.},

The objective of the paper is to evaluate the market acceptability of three native chili products: (a) chili marmalade; (b) chili cooking paste; and (c) pickled chilies. Multi-product Becker-DeGroot-Marschak experimental auctions and hedonic tests were conducted with 337 participants in La Paz and Santa Cruz. Data were analyzed using seemingly unrelated regressions. Results suggest that consumers are willing to pay price premiums of about
25–50 percent. Biodiversity conservation and improvements in farmers’ quality of life statements would not have influence on first purchase decisions but rather on repurchase decisions and therefore on consumers’ product loyalty. This in turn could lead to sustainable
agro-biodiversity conservation, centered on consumers’ purchase of these products over time.},

abstract = {Sustainable development, although a widely used phrase and idea, has many different meanings and therefore provokes many different responses. In broad terms, the concept of sustainable development is an attempt to combine growing concerns about a range of environmental issues with socio-economic issues. To aid understanding of these different policies this paper presents a classification and mapping of different trends of thought on sustainable development, their political and policy frameworks and their attitudes towards change and means of change. Sustainable development has the potential to address fundamental challenges for humanity, now and into the future. However, to do this, it needs more clarity of meaning, concentrating on sustainable livelihoods and well-being rather than well-having, and long term environmental sustainability, which requires a strong basis in principles that link the social and environmental to human equity.

abstract = {This study quantifies and maps the water footprint (WF) of humanity at a high spatial resolution. It reports on consumptive use of rainwater (green WF) and ground and surface water (blue WF) and volumes of water polluted (gray WF). Water footprints are estimated per nation from both a production and consumption perspective. International virtual water flows are estimated based on trade in agricultural and industrial commodities. The global annual average WF in the period 1996-2005 was 9,087 Gm(3)/y (74{\%} green, 11{\%} blue, 15{\%} gray). Agricultural production contributes 92{\%}. About one-fifth of the global WF relates to production for export. The total volume of international virtual water flows related to trade in agricultural and industrial products was 2,320 Gm(3)/y (68{\%} green, 13{\%} blue, 19{\%} gray). The WF of the global average consumer was 1,385 m(3)/y. The average consumer in the United States has a WF of 2,842 m(3)/y, whereas the average citizens in China and India have WFs of 1,071 and 1,089 m(3)/y, respectively. Consumption of cereal products gives the largest contribution to the WF of the average consumer (27{\%}), followed by meat (22{\%}) and milk products (7{\%}). The volume and pattern of consumption and the WF per ton of product of the products consumed are the main factors determining the WF of a consumer. The study illustrates the global dimension of water consumption and pollution by showing that several countries heavily rely on foreign water resources and that many countries have significant impacts on water consumption and pollution elsewhere.},

abstract = {Policies for promoting the in situ conservation of underutilized crop varieties include the provision of economic incentives to farmers for their market commercialization. Nevertheless, market participation could also have the counter-effect of favoring the cultivation of uniform commercial crop varieties and inducing the erosion of crop genetic diversity. The objective of this research was to identify the determinants of the in situ conservation of native chili varieties, including market participation. To this end,  128 farmers were surveyed in the Amazon rainforest region of Ucayali in Peru. The data were analyzed using probit, multinomial logit and truncated Poisson models with covariance matrix correction for cluster errors by rural community. Results suggest that participation in commercial agriculture statistically significantly increases the in situ conservation of native chili varieties; only when farmers sell their products to local retailers, but not when they supply wholesalers. In particular, this result implies that policies designed to encourage specific forms of market participation could have a positive effect on farmers’ economic well-being and simultaneously could help to achieve crop genetic diversity conservation goals.},

25–50 percent. Biodiversity conservation and improvements in farmers’ quality of life statements would not have influence on first purchase decisions but rather on repurchase decisions and therefore on consumers’ product loyalty. This in turn could lead to sustainable
agro-biodiversity conservation, centered on consumers’ purchase of these products over time.},

abstract = {This study quantifies and maps the water footprint (WF) of humanity at a high spatial resolution. It reports on consumptive use of rainwater (green WF) and ground and surface water (blue WF) and volumes of water polluted (gray WF). Water footprints are estimated per nation from both a production and consumption perspective. International virtual water flows are estimated based on trade in agricultural and industrial commodities. The global annual average WF in the period 1996-2005 was 9,087 Gm(3)/y (74{\%} green, 11{\%} blue, 15{\%} gray). Agricultural production contributes 92{\%}. About one-fifth of the global WF relates to production for export. The total volume of international virtual water flows related to trade in agricultural and industrial products was 2,320 Gm(3)/y (68{\%} green, 13{\%} blue, 19{\%} gray). The WF of the global average consumer was 1,385 m(3)/y. The average consumer in the United States has a WF of 2,842 m(3)/y, whereas the average citizens in China and India have WFs of 1,071 and 1,089 m(3)/y, respectively. Consumption of cereal products gives the largest contribution to the WF of the average consumer (27{\%}), followed by meat (22{\%}) and milk products (7{\%}). The volume and pattern of consumption and the WF per ton of product of the products consumed are the main factors determining the WF of a consumer. The study illustrates the global dimension of water consumption and pollution by showing that several countries heavily rely on foreign water resources and that many countries have significant impacts on water consumption and pollution elsewhere.},

A potential high value pro-poor market for selling native chilies is the international tourism segment. The objectives of this research were to assess the acceptability of the potential introduction of dried native chilies in the international tourism segment by identifying the motivations for buying dried chilies as souvenirs, and then by evaluating the factors influencing the price premiums’ magnitudes related to different label information conditions, such as information about the farmer community, traditional cooking recipes, organic certification, and Fairtrade certification. A face-to-face survey was conducted with 200 international tourists at the airport in Cuzco, Peru. The data were analyzed using a probit and tobit models with sample selection. The results suggest that dried native chilies would have a relatively good acceptance among international tourists. About 62{\%} of the respondents indicated they would buy dried native chilies, and of them, 62{\%}–74{\%} would pay an average price premium ranging from S/1.16–1.58 for different label information conditions. Nevertheless specific marketing campaigns should be designed for different types of international tourists in order to maximize the economic benefits for small-holder farmers.},

The resulting distribution confirms a bias towards incre- mental process innovations, but points towards interesting characteristics in radicalarchitectural modes of eco-innovation, e.g. the tendency to combine hard- ware and software, or technology and social arrangements, the combination of generically diverse technologies and finally the eco-enabling of old technologies by the application of new ones.

abstract = {While innovation processes toward sustainable development (eco-innovations) have received increasing attention during the past years, theoretical and methodological approaches to analyze these processes are poorly developed. Against this background, the term eco-innovation is introduced in this paper addressing explicitly three kinds of changes towards sustainable development: technological, social and institutional innovation. Secondly, the potential contribution of neoclassical and (co-)evolutionary approaches from environmental and innovation economics to eco-innovation research is discussed. Three peculiarities of eco-innovation are identified: the double externality problem, the regulatory push/pull effect and the increasing importance of social and institutional innovation. While the first two are widely ignored in innovation economics, the third is at the least not elaborated appropriately. The consideration of these peculiarities may help to overcome market failure by establishing a specific eco-innovation policy and to avoid a `technology bias' through a broader understanding of innovation. Finally, perspectives for a specific contribution of ecological economics to eco-innovation research are drawn. It is argued that methodological pluralism as established in ecological economics would be very beneficial for eco-innovation research. A theoretical framework integrating elements from both neoclassical and evolutionary approaches should be pursued in order to consider the complexity of factors influencing innovation decisions as well as the specific role of regulatory instruments. And the experience gathered in ecological economics integrating ecological, social and economic aspects of sustainable development is highly useful for opening up innovation research to social and institutional changes},

The resulting distribution confirms a bias towards incre- mental process innovations, but points towards interesting characteristics in radicalarchitectural modes of eco-innovation, e.g. the tendency to combine hard- ware and software, or technology and social arrangements, the combination of generically diverse technologies and finally the eco-enabling of old technologies by the application of new ones.

Fewer local farmers cultivate native chilies annually due to low market demand. Increasing its private use value can lead to the in-situ conservation of this crop. The objective of the paper is to evaluate the market acceptability of three native chili products: (a) chili marmalade; (b) chili cooking paste; and (c) pickled chilies. Multi-product Becker-DeGroot-Marschak experimental auctions and hedonic tests were conducted with 337 participants in La Paz and Santa Cruz. Data were analyzed using seemingly unrelated regressions. Results suggest that consumers are willing to pay price premiums of about
25–50 percent. Biodiversity conservation and improvements in farmers’ quality of life statements would not have influence on first purchase decisions but rather on repurchase decisions and therefore on consumers’ product loyalty. This in turn could lead to sustainable
agro-biodiversity conservation, centered on consumers’ purchase of these products over time.},

abstract = {Policies for promoting the in situ conservation of underutilized crop varieties include the provision of economic incentives to farmers for their market commercialization. Nevertheless, market participation could also have the counter-effect of favoring the cultivation of uniform commercial crop varieties and inducing the erosion of crop genetic diversity. The objective of this research was to identify the determinants of the in situ conservation of native chili varieties, including market participation. To this end,  128 farmers were surveyed in the Amazon rainforest region of Ucayali in Peru. The data were analyzed using probit, multinomial logit and truncated Poisson models with covariance matrix correction for cluster errors by rural community.

abstract = {Policies for promoting the in situ conservation of underutilized crop varieties include the provision of economic incentives to farmers for their market commercialization. Nevertheless, market participation could also have the counter-effect of favoring the cultivation of uniform commercial crop varieties and inducing the erosion of crop genetic diversity. The objective of this research was to identify the determinants of the in situ conservation of native chili varieties, including market participation. To this end,  128 farmers were surveyed in the Amazon rainforest region of Ucayali in Peru. The data were analyzed using probit, multinomial logit and truncated Poisson models with covariance matrix correction for cluster errors by rural community. Results suggest that participation in commercial agriculture statistically significantly increases the in situ conservation of native chili varieties; only when farmers sell their products to local retailers, but not when they supply wholesalers.

abstract = {Many urban analysts believe suburban sprawl has become an important issue be- cause it helps generate two types of problems: growth-related difficulties like rising traffic congestion, and high concentrations of poor minority households in core-area neighborhoods. However, a careful regression analysis of measures of both sprawl and urban decline shows no statistically significant relation between these two conditions. The basic nature of the American urban development process would cause core- area poverty concentrations even if sprawl were replaced by more compact growth forms. But sprawl does aggravate growth-related problems. Those problems could be attacked through either alternative overall growth strategies—such as high- density, tightly bounded growth—or specific anti-sprawl tactics, such as regional tax-base sharing and regional coordination of land uses. But no feasible policies are likely either to alleviate traffic congestion much or cause most American regions to abandon sprawl.},

We conclude that, while the amount of time required to edit and buffer road coverages is significantly higher than that for traditional remote sensing techniques, the improved thematic accuracy, spatial contiguity, and potential future uses of the resulting dataset justifies its use in a state-wide mapping program.},

abstract = {The issue of treating cities as complex and emergent structures has been raised during the past two decades, posing serious questions and casting further light upon the understanding of the urban phenomena. Cities are considered to be systems of organized complexity with a distinct hierarchical order. The application of fractal geometry at the analysis of the urban development patterns has been widely investigated during the last two decades, together with the cellular automata and the agent-based models. Based on the recognition that urban patterns are highly complex, heterogeneous and hierarchically ordered revealing self-similarity across scales, numerous models of fractal analysis have been applied at the study of the urbanization processes. Fractals are by definition complex, hierarchically ordered structures revealing self-similarity across scales presenting remarkable similarities to urban built-up patterns, urban boudaries, land use distribution etc. Fractals have been widely used in order to distinguish between different urban typologies, to measure the degree of urban sprawl and examine the way cities expand in space and time. Although researches on the field are recent and certainly much remains to be done, the results coming from various application all over the world confirm the fact that urban systems present a fractal strucutre: It is therefore through this new geometrical perspective that the strucutral and functional properties of the systems should be described, and new properties which until now where considered too complex to be analyzed should be examined.},

abstract = {The literature on urban sprawl confuses causes, consequences, and conditions. This article presents a conceptual definition of sprawl based on eight distinct dimensions of land use patterns: density, continuity, concentration, clustering, centrality, nuclearity, mixed uses, and proximity. Sprawl is defined as a condition of land use that is repre- sented by low values on one or more of these dimensions. Each dimension is operationally defined and tested in 13 urbanized areas. Results for six dimensions are reported for each area, and an initial comparison of the extent of sprawl in the 13 areas is provided. The test confirms the utility of the approach and suggests that a clearer conceptual and operational definition can facilitate research on the causes and consequences of sprawl.},

abstract = {The issue of treating cities as complex and emergent structures has been raised during the past two decades, posing serious questions and casting further light upon the understanding of the urban phenomena. Cities are considered to be systems of organized complexity with a distinct hierarchical order. The application of fractal geometry at the analysis of the urban development patterns has been widely investigated during the last two decades, together with the cellular automata and the agent-based models. Based on the recognition that urban patterns are highly complex, heterogeneous and hierarchically ordered revealing self-similarity across scales, numerous models of fractal analysis have been applied at the study of the urbanization processes. Fractals are by definition complex, hierarchically ordered structures revealing self-similarity across scales presenting remarkable similarities to urban built-up patterns, urban boudaries, land use distribution etc. Fractals have been widely used in order to distinguish between different urban typologies, to measure the degree of urban sprawl and examine the way cities expand in space and time. Although researches on the field are recent and certainly much remains to be done, the results coming from various application all over the world confirm the fact that urban systems present a fractal strucutre: It is therefore through this new geometrical perspective that the strucutral and functional properties of the systems should be described, and new properties which until now where considered too complex to be analyzed should be examined.},

abstract = {The present paper has adopted an exploratory and multidimensional approach to analyse urban sprawl in Europe. A literature review revealed the complexity of the phenomenon and the great variety of points of view from which it has been considered, both outside and inside academia, as well as across many diverse disciplines (economics, geography, urban planning, etc.). The main characteris- tics concluded from the review were conceptualized into a set of six dimensions of urban sprawl that were divided into two main categories: urban morphology, and internal composition. This provided us with a working definition of sprawl that was both as complete as possible and accurate. In order to be able to apply it to real-world data, we specified an index to capture each of the six dimensions and computed them using a representative sample of European urban regions, in which we distinguished between urban patches and other types of landuses in order to make accurate calculations. Once we had collected all data for each city on each of the dimensions, we brought together all the information through the use of the SOM algorithm, a method that compresses highly dimensional data without loss of relevant information, and makes it possible to visualize them in order to identify patterns and regularities. This approach is novel in two senses: on the one hand, it considers the European region, an issue that has been paid very little attention but, at the same time, it is of great interest, in particular for an issue such as urban sprawl; on the other hand, it uses the SOM algorithm to compress the data about the different dimensions so that no useful information is lost but it is presented in a way understandable for the human brain. After the algorithm was run, we obtained a trained network that allowed us to develop the bulk of the analysis. The distribution of the values of the different dimensions across the network confirmed the need for this type of approach, since each of them follow a different pattern, which indicates that just one component does not summarize well the other results. Furthermore, this stage was also useful to identify what we called the archetypal sprawling city as one where: commuting times are high; decentralization is medium-high; density, availability to open space and land-use mix are low; and scattering of the urban development is high. Then we considered the actual input cities, and looked at how they had been mapped across the network by the SOM. We performed two exercises in the search for relevant patterns: the first was intended to link the geographical location of the urban regions to their characteristics in terms of sprawl, while the second aimed to determine whether population size has any kind of association with the variables of sprawl. The main conclusion we could draw from pulling both together was that the sprawling city in Europe is one of medium-small size, located in the central, western, or southern part of the mainland.},

However, despite the level of attention that is afforded spral, there remains relatively little understanding of its determinants and its constitution. Previous attemps to measure sprawl have focused largely on costing out its impacts rather than quantifying its characteristics. Also, the characterization of sprawl is often confused with general suburbanization and remains, in many cases, without clear empirical foundation. This paucity of understanding casts doubts about the effectiveness of growth management and smart growth policies and inhibits the ability of planners to inform public policy in a reasoned manner. This paper contributes to the debate about sprawl by offering a suite of tools that help to characterize its attributes in a quantifiable manner.},

abstract = {Currently, debates over urban form have generally focused on the contrast between the “sprawl” often seen as typical of the United States and “compact” urban forms found in parts of Europe. Although these debates are presumed to have implications for developing worlds as well, systematic comparison of urban forms between developed and developing countries has been lacking. This paper utilized satellite images of 77 metropolitan areas in Asia, US, Europe, Latin America and Australia to calculate seven spatial metrics that capture five distinct dimensions of urban form. Comparison of the spatial metrics was firstly made between developed and developing countries, and then among world regions. A cluster analysis classifies the cities into groups in terms of these spatial metrics. The paper also explored the origins of differences in urban form through comparison with socio-economic developmental indicators and historical trajectories in urban development. The result clearly demonstrates that urban agglomerations of developingworld are more compact and dense than their counterparts in either Europe or North America. Moreover, there are also striking differences in urban form across regions.},

abstract = {Many urban analysts believe suburban sprawl has become an important issue be- cause it helps generate two types of problems: growth-related difficulties like rising traffic congestion, and high concentrations of poor minority households in core-area neighborhoods. However, a careful regression analysis of measures of both sprawl and urban decline shows no statistically significant relation between these two conditions. The basic nature of the American urban development process would cause core- area poverty concentrations even if sprawl were replaced by more compact growth forms. But sprawl does aggravate growth-related problems. Those problems could be attacked through either alternative overall growth strategies—such as high- density, tightly bounded growth—or specific anti-sprawl tactics, such as regional tax-base sharing and regional coordination of land uses. But no feasible policies are likely either to alleviate traffic congestion much or cause most American regions to abandon sprawl.},

However, trajectories and rhythms of sprawl may vary in important ways according to specific geographical and historical characteristics, and these differences need to be contrasted with specificcase studies especially for the booming urbanization of the Global South. The purpose of this paper is to study urban growth in the city of Yazd, Iran. Urban growth and other land uses were calculated through treated satellite images for four periods: 1975, 1987, 2000 and 2009. Results reveal that from 1975 to 2009, the urbanized area increased from 1843 ha to 13,802 ha; that is a rate close to three times the population growth observed for the same period. The Yazd case is interesting for several reasons: first, it is a case of very fast urban growth even for a developing country; second, it illustrates how the fastest rates of urban sprawl may correspond to middle size cities rather than large centers. Third, it portrays a land substi- tution process in which agricultural land is not the primary provider of urban land which is relatively rare in urban contexts, and fourth, it also illustrate how sprawl may also hide important internal land uses such as the presence of agricultural plots within urban boundaries.},

abstract = {Urban growth is a spatial and demographic process and refers to the increased importance of towns and cities as a concentration of population within a particular economy and society. Analysis of urban growth by using the historical and present data is an essentially performed operation in the urban geographic studies and for future planning. Urban growth can be mapped, measured and modelled by using remote sensing data and GIS techniques along with several statistical measures. In this study three temporal satellite images of 15 years interval (1975, 1990 and 2005) have been classified to determine the urban extent and growth of Kolkata-Howrah (West Bengal, India) in eight different directions within a circular region. Pearson’s chi-square test and Shannon’s entropy method have been applied to calculate the degree-of-freedom and degree-of-sprawl towards the analysis of urban growth. A new measure, degree-of-goodness, has also been proposed for the analysis of urban growth. The result shows that the city of Kolkata-Howrah has a high degree-of-freedom, high sprawl, and a negative goodness in urban growth. Apart from the derived results, this study also shows the potentials of remote sensing data and effectiveness of demonstrated/ proposed models in urban geographic studies. },

abstract = {Across the nation, growing numbers of communities are discovering links between urban sprawl and a wide range of problems, from traffic and air pollution to central city poverty and the degradation of scenic areas. As more civic leaders take steps to ameliorate these costs, they are in increasing need of meaningful information about the characteristics, extent and consequences of sprawl. This study represents a rigorous effort to measure the characteristics of sprawl and their impacts on quality of life. In this study, sprawl is defined as low-density development with residential, shopping and office areas that are rigidly segregated; a lack of thriving activity centers; and limited choices in travel routes. These features constitute four factors that can then be measured and analyzed: 1) Residential density; 2) Neighborhood mix of homes, jobs, and services; 3) Strength of centers, such as business districts; and 4) Accessibility via the street network. All of these are well-established descriptors of urban sprawl in the relevant academic literature, but this study represents the first effort to attempt to measure sprawl in all of these dimensions. The heart of this project is an extensive database that allows for both the careful measurement of urban sprawl as well as the assessment of its relationship to a wide variety of quality-of-life indicators. The database contains two sets of variables. The first set includes 22 variables grouped into the four factors that characterize sprawl. The second set of data includes dozens of indicators of community quality of life, including everything from how much people drive every day to the consumption of farmland and forests. This report is the first of several that will assess the impact of sprawl on these important outcomes. This research is significant for two main reasons. First, it is by far the most comprehensive attempt to define and quantify urban sprawl in the U.S. Some studies have defined sprawl simply in terms of the amount of land used as the population grows, but ignoring the form in which that growth occurs. This study shows that sprawl is not just growth, but is a specific, and dysfunctional, style of growth. By evaluating metropolitan growth patterns based on four factors, this research presents a highly detailed portrait of sprawl that will enable decision-makers to target their growth management strategies more effectively. Second, and perhaps more importantly, this study analyzes how growth patterns and affect everyday things that people value. In other words, the researchers have demonstrated that sprawl is a real, measurable phenomenon, and it has real, measurable consequences for people. This first volume presents sprawl measures for 83 of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States and examines the relationships between urban sprawl and transportation-related measures, including vehicle miles traveled, traffic fatalities, the extent of walking and public transit use, roadway congestion and air quality. Future volumes will address how sprawl may be influencing other outcome measures, such as the decline of central cities, the loss of open space, the degradation of scenic areas, and impacts on public health. Also, some data will be examined at the county level to explore the variation of development patterns within different metropolitan areas.},

This approach is novel in two senses: on the one hand, it considers the European region, an issue that has been paid very little attention but, at the same time, it is of great interest, in particular for an issue such as urban sprawl; on the other hand, it uses the SOM algorithm to compress the data about the different dimensions so that no useful information is lost but it is presented in a way understandable for the human brain. After the algorithm was run, we obtained a trained network that allowed us to develop the bulk of the analysis. The distribution of the values of the different dimensions across the network confirmed the need for this type of approach, since each of them follow a different pattern, which indicates that just one component does not summarize well the other results. Furthermore, this stage was also useful to identify what we called the archetypal sprawling city as one where: commuting times are high; decentralization is medium-high; density, availability to open space and land-use mix are low; and scattering of the urban development is high. Then we considered the actual input cities, and looked at how they had been mapped across the network by the SOM. We performed two exercises in the search for relevant patterns: the first was intended to link the geographical location of the urban regions to their characteristics in terms of sprawl, while the second aimed to determine whether population size has any kind of association with the variables of sprawl. The main conclusion we could draw from pulling both together was that the sprawling city in Europe is one of medium-small size, located in the central, western, or southern part of the mainland.},

abstract = {The literature on urban sprawl confuses causes, consequences, and conditions. This article presents a conceptual definition of sprawl based on eight distinct dimensions of land use patterns: density, continuity, concentration, clustering, centrality, nuclearity, mixed uses, and proximity. Sprawl is defined as a condition of land use that is repre- sented by low values on one or more of these dimensions. Each dimension is operationally defined and tested in 13 urbanized areas. Results for six dimensions are reported for each area, and an initial comparison of the extent of sprawl in the 13 areas is provided. The test confirms the utility of the approach and suggests that a clearer conceptual and operational definition can facilitate research on the causes and consequences of sprawl.},

abstract = {Surburban sprawl is one of the most avidly followed urban issues in the United States today. However, despite the level of attention that is afforded spral, there remains relatively little understanding of its determinants and its constitution. Previous attemps to measure sprawl have focused largely on costing out its impacts rather than quantifying its characteristics. Also, the characterization of sprawl is often confused with general suburbanization and remains, in many cases, without clear empirical foundation. This paucity of understanding casts doubts about the effectiveness of growth management and smart growth policies and inhibits the ability of planners to inform public policy in a reasoned manner. This paper contributes to the debate about sprawl by offering a suite of tools that help to characterize its attributes in a quantifiable manner.},

abstract = {Urban sprawl has become a remarkable characteristic of urban development worldwide in the last decades. However, trajectories and rhythms of sprawl may vary in important ways according to specific geographical and historical characteristics, and these differences need to be contrasted with specificcase studies especially for the booming urbanization of the Global South. The purpose of this paper is to study urban growth in the city of Yazd, Iran. Urban growth and other land uses were calculated through treated satellite images for four periods: 1975, 1987, 2000 and 2009. Results reveal that from 1975 to 2009, the urbanized area increased from 1843 ha to 13,802 ha; that is a rate close to three times the population growth observed for the same period. The Yazd case is interesting for several reasons: first, it is a case of very fast urban growth even for a developing country; second, it illustrates how the fastest rates of urban sprawl may correspond to middle size cities rather than large centers. Third, it portrays a land substi- tution process in which agricultural land is not the primary provider of urban land which is relatively rare in urban contexts, and fourth, it also illustrate how sprawl may also hide important internal land uses such as the presence of agricultural plots within urban boundaries.},

Proximity of home and work to restaurants was assessed by Global Index System (GIS) methodology. RESULTS: Eating at "fast food" restaurants was positively associated with having children, a high fat diet and Body Mass Index (BMI).

@article{Norrie2004,
abstract = {In this paper, we discuss ways that project managers can use measurement (using a tool such as the balanced scorecard) to improve the operational performance of their project teams. Project managers will see that attaching measures to outcomes clarifies project objectives and supports well-defined and well-communicated links between the project vision and business strategy. These also enable project managers to more effectively monitor and control project activities for the purpose of improving project results. This paper reinforces the importance of strategy as an added dimension to the traditional triple constraint. We present this information through our comparison and survey of two projects undertaken by project teams at a large North American global telecommunications organization. The results of our study provide early evidence of the usefulness of the balanced scorecard (BSC) as a tool for improving project management effectiveness. Our study also shows that balanced performance measurement is an important technique for establishing on-strategy project delivery. We propose using this technique primarily as an extension of current practices by adding a strategic measurement dimension.},

With current projections indicating that approximately 70 percent of the world's population will live in cities by 2050, an increase in urban energy use is inevitable. In the face of this growing energy demand, developing climate-friendly urban energy solutions, while protecting the urban development that is crucial to socioeconomic progress in developing countries, is imperative.In an effort to catalyze solutions that would delink high levels of carbon-intensive energy use from urban growth, the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) of the world Bank launchched the Energy Efficient Cities Initiative in October 2008. Energy Efficient Cities: Assessment Tools and Benchmarking Practices is a product of that initiative.The analytical tools and policy insights offered in this volume extend from integrated assessments of new cities to the impacts of socioeconomic, climate, and demographic changes on existing cities, In addition, the documentation and benchmarking of a variety of low-carbon and carbon-neutral good practices provide a range of practical insights on plausible energy efficient interventions in urban sectors. This book will be of particular interest to policy makers, development practitioners, and decision makers in the private sector, as well as researchers within nongovernmental organizations and the academic community.The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAR) is a global knowledge and technical assistance trust fund administered by the World Bank that assists low and middle-income countries to increase know how and institutional capacity to achieve environmentally sustainable energy solutions for poverty reduction and economic growth.

@article{Borghesi2003a,
abstract = {The recent process of globalisation of international markets has managed to sustain the economic growth of the countries that have actively participated in this process. The available empirical evidence suggests, however, that it has been accompanied by a worldwide increase in environmental degradation and economic inequality. Therefore, there is growing concern that these features of the globalisation process may jeopardise its social and environmental sustainability. In order to clarify to what extent the recent process of globalisation may be considered as sustainable, this paper draws some hints from a critical assessment of the literature on the Kuznets curve and the environmental Kuznets curve. In particular it is argued that the optimistic implications of this literature on the sustainability of globalisation are ungranted and that the Kuznets approach is in principle unable to give reliable answers to the questions raised in this work. These curves, however, may be generalised as Kuznets relations whose analysis allows a clarification of a few basic conditions for sustainable globalisation. We conclude that these conditions can be met by implementing a systematic policy strategy aimed at shifting both Kuznets relations downwards.},

abstract = {Government agencies responsible for pest animal management often assume that their views and assumptions about the benefits of control are widely shared, especially if these pests are exotics. This was certainly the case when tens of thousands of feral Asian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) were to be culled in Australia's Kakadu National Park as part of a national Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign (BTEC). Implementation of the campaign sparked considerable dispute between officials and aboriginal and non-aboriginal interests about the risks posed by buffalo relative to their value as a potential resource. Drawing upon a variety of written and oral sources relating to the era of buffalo control in Kakadu, this paper critically analyzes the way in which detriment caused by buffalo was appraised and managed under the BTEC program. In particular, the paper focuses the ways in which the BTEC program affected aboriginal people in Kakadu, who view buffalo as a source of customary and economic benefit as well as a source of change on their lands. The paper then considers what lessons can be learned from the BTEC for the development of sensible feral management objectives and strategies. It is argued that effective management of feral animals such as buffalo will require environmental managers to engage with local people and involve them in the definition and management of pest animal damage and methods of control.},

The fundamental components of a laboratory QA program include providing a functional and safe laboratory environment, trained and competent personnel, maintained equipment, adequate supplies and reagents, testing of appropriate specimens, internal monitoring of quality, accurate reporting, and external quality assessments. These components are necessary to provide accurate and precise CD4 T-cell counts, an essential test to evaluate start of and monitor effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected patients. In recent years, CD4 testing has expanded dramatically in resource-limited settings. Information on a CD4 QA program as described in this article will provide guidelines not only for clinical laboratory staff but also for managers of programs responsible for supporting CD4 testing. All agencies involved in implementing CD4 testing must understand the needs of the laboratory and provide advocacy, guidance, and financial support to established CD4 testing sites and programs. This article describes and explains the procedures that must be put in place to provide reliable CD4 determinations in a variety of settings.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using an integrated process analytical technology (PAT) approach to determine nucleation and growth mechanisms of a dynamic naproxen (drug)-Eudragit L100 (polymer) coprecipitation process. The influence of several thermodynamically important formulation and process variables (drug/polymer ratio, alcohol, and water usages) on coprecipitation process characteristics was investigated via real-time in situ focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) monitoring and near real-time particle vision microscopy measurement. The final products were characterized by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and NIR chemical imaging microscopy. The coprecipitation nucleation induction time (t(ind) ) was measured by both FBRM trend statistics and process trajectory method, respectively. Furthermore, nucleation kinetics was evaluated based on t(ind) measurement and corresponding supersaturation ratio (S) estimated. It was found that plots of ln(t(ind) ) versus (ln(2) S)(-1) consist of two linear segments and are consistent with classical primary nucleation mechanisms. Apparently, the coprecipitation process is governed by heterogeneous primary nucleation mechanism at low S (14 ≤ S ≤ 503) and by homogeneous primary nucleation mechanism at high S (1216 ≤ S ≤ 3649). Off-line characterizations collectively supported this statement. Therefore, it demonstrated that integration real-time PAT process monitoring with first-principles modeling and off-line product characterization could enhance understanding to coprecipitation process dynamics and nucleation/growth mechanisms, which is impossible via off-line techniques alone.},

abstract = {Government agencies responsible for pest animal management often assume that their views and assumptions about the benefits of control are widely shared, especially if these pests are exotics. This was certainly the case when tens of thousands of feral Asian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) were to be culled in Australia's Kakadu National Park as part of a national Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign (BTEC). Implementation of the campaign sparked considerable dispute between officials and aboriginal and non-aboriginal interests about the risks posed by buffalo relative to their value as a potential resource. Drawing upon a variety of written and oral sources relating to the era of buffalo control in Kakadu, this paper critically analyzes the way in which detriment caused by buffalo was appraised and managed under the BTEC program. In particular, the paper focuses the ways in which the BTEC program affected aboriginal people in Kakadu, who view buffalo as a source of customary and economic benefit as well as a source of change on their lands. The paper then considers what lessons can be learned from the BTEC for the development of sensible feral management objectives and strategies. It is argued that effective management of feral animals such as buffalo will require environmental managers to engage with local people and involve them in the definition and management of pest animal damage and methods of control.},

abstract = {Urban areas account for two-thirds of global energy requriements while housing half of the world's population. With current projections indicating that approximately 70 percent of the world's population will live in cities by 2050, an increase in urban energy use is inevitable. In the face of this growing energy demand, developing climate-friendly urban energy solutions, while protecting the urban development that is crucial to socioeconomic progress in developing countries, is imperative.In an effort to catalyze solutions that would delink high levels of carbon-intensive energy use from urban growth, the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) of the world Bank launchched the Energy Efficient Cities Initiative in October 2008. Energy Efficient Cities: Assessment Tools and Benchmarking Practices is a product of that initiative.The analytical tools and policy insights offered in this volume extend from integrated assessments of new cities to the impacts of socioeconomic, climate, and demographic changes on existing cities, In addition, the documentation and benchmarking of a variety of low-carbon and carbon-neutral good practices provide a range of practical insights on plausible energy efficient interventions in urban sectors. This book will be of particular interest to policy makers, development practitioners, and decision makers in the private sector, as well as researchers within nongovernmental organizations and the academic community.The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAR) is a global knowledge and technical assistance trust fund administered by the World Bank that assists low and middle-income countries to increase know how and institutional capacity to achieve environmentally sustainable energy solutions for poverty reduction and economic growth.

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss ways that project managers can use measurement (using a tool such as the balanced scorecard) to improve the operational performance of their project teams. Project managers will see that attaching measures to outcomes clarifies project objectives and supports well-defined and well-communicated links between the project vision and business strategy. These also enable project managers to more effectively monitor and control project activities for the purpose of improving project results. This paper reinforces the importance of strategy as an added dimension to the traditional triple constraint. We present this information through our comparison and survey of two projects undertaken by project teams at a large North American global telecommunications organization. The results of our study provide early evidence of the usefulness of the balanced scorecard (BSC) as a tool for improving project management effectiveness. Our study also shows that balanced performance measurement is an important technique for establishing on-strategy project delivery. We propose using this technique primarily as an extension of current practices by adding a strategic measurement dimension.},

abstract = {Intense competition forces companies to become involved in supply chain collaboration with their upstream and downstream partners. The key to ensuring that the participating members are progressing on the right track of creating the best-in-class practice is to conduct benchmarking. Benchmarking stimulates collective learning for performance improvement that brings benefits to all participating members. However, previous research has focused mainly on supply chain benchmarking at the intra-company rather than the inter-company level. Inter-company benchmarking requires a new perspective for understanding collaborative learning amongst the participating members that encourages them to improve supply chain performance as a whole. This research aims to develop a benchmarking scheme for supply chain collaboration that links collaborative performance metrics and collaborative enablers. The proposed benchmarking scheme can be used to examine the current status of supply chain collaboration among the participating members, identify performance gaps and systematize improvement initiatives.},

@article{Borghesi2003,
abstract = {The recent process of globalisation of international markets has managed to sustain the economic growth of the countries that have actively participated in this process. The available empirical evidence suggests, however, that it has been accompanied by a worldwide increase in environmental degradation and economic inequality. Therefore, there is growing concern that these features of the globalisation process may jeopardise its social and environmental sustainability. In order to clarify to what extent the recent process of globalisation may be considered as sustainable, this paper draws some hints from a critical assessment of the literature on the Kuznets curve and the environmental Kuznets curve. In particular it is argued that the optimistic implications of this literature on the sustainability of globalisation are ungranted and that the Kuznets approach is in principle unable to give reliable answers to the questions raised in this work. These curves, however, may be generalised as Kuznets relations whose analysis allows a clarification of a few basic conditions for sustainable globalisation. We conclude that these conditions can be met by implementing a systematic policy strategy aimed at shifting both Kuznets relations downwards.},

The fundamental components of a laboratory QA program include providing a functional and safe laboratory environment, trained and competent personnel, maintained equipment, adequate supplies and reagents, testing of appropriate specimens, internal monitoring of quality, accurate reporting, and external quality assessments. These components are necessary to provide accurate and precise CD4 T-cell counts, an essential test to evaluate start of and monitor effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected patients. In recent years, CD4 testing has expanded dramatically in resource-limited settings. Information on a CD4 QA program as described in this article will provide guidelines not only for clinical laboratory staff but also for managers of programs responsible for supporting CD4 testing. All agencies involved in implementing CD4 testing must understand the needs of the laboratory and provide advocacy, guidance, and financial support to established CD4 testing sites and programs. This article describes and explains the procedures that must be put in place to provide reliable CD4 determinations in a variety of settings.},

abstract = {Improving the efficiency of urban energy systems is an increasingly important issue, as the energy consumption of cities has a significant effect on energy and climate policy priorities. One promising strategy for delivering these results is to increase the integration of energy services, for example through the use of combined heat and power systems. This paper introduces a tool for analyzing such integrated energy systems and demonstrates it in the case of a UK eco-town supplied with heat and power from biomass sources. We conclude that the methodology is a powerful tool for assessing potentially convoluted resource chains, a common feature of biomass energy strategies. While biomass offers a promising low-carbon solution for eco-towns such as the one studied here, we note that significant uncertainties remain in cost, carbon performance and resource availability.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss ways that project managers can use measurement (using a tool such as the balanced scorecard) to improve the operational performance of their project teams. Project managers will see that attaching measures to outcomes clarifies project objectives and supports well-defined and well-communicated links between the project vision and business strategy. These also enable project managers to more effectively monitor and control project activities for the purpose of improving project results. This paper reinforces the importance of strategy as an added dimension to the traditional triple constraint. We present this information through our comparison and survey of two projects undertaken by project teams at a large North American global telecommunications organization. The results of our study provide early evidence of the usefulness of the balanced scorecard (BSC) as a tool for improving project management effectiveness. Our study also shows that balanced performance measurement is an important technique for establishing on-strategy project delivery. We propose using this technique primarily as an extension of current practices by adding a strategic measurement dimension.},

abstract = {In most organizations, supply chain planning is a cross-functional effort. Functional areas such as sales, marketing, finance, and operations traditionally specialize in portions of the planning activities, which results in conflicts over expectations, preferences, and priorities. We report findings from a detailed case analysis of a successful supply chain planning process. In contrast to traditional research on this area, which focuses on incentives, responsibilities, and structures, we adopt a process perspective and find that integration was achieved despite an incentive landscape that did not support it. By drawing a distinction between the incentive landscape and the planning process, we identify process as an additional mediator beyond the incentive landscape that can affect organizational outcomes. Thus, organizations may be capable of integration while different functions retain different incentives to maintain focus on their stakeholders’ needs. Through iterative coding, we identified the requisite attributes of the planning process that drive planning performance—informational, procedural, and alignment quality— but hypothesize that achieving alignment in the execution of plans can be more important than informational and procedural quality. In addition to process attributes, we also identify social elements that influenced the performance of the planning process and place the information processing attributes within a broader social and organizational context.},

abstract = {Quality assurance (QA) is a systematic process to monitor and improve clinical laboratory practices. The fundamental components of a laboratory QA program include providing a functional and safe laboratory environment, trained and competent personnel, maintained equipment, adequate supplies and reagents, testing of appropriate specimens, internal monitoring of quality, accurate reporting, and external quality assessments. These components are necessary to provide accurate and precise CD4 T-cell counts, an essential test to evaluate start of and monitor effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected patients. In recent years, CD4 testing has expanded dramatically in resource-limited settings. Information on a CD4 QA program as described in this article will provide guidelines not only for clinical laboratory staff but also for managers of programs responsible for supporting CD4 testing. All agencies involved in implementing CD4 testing must understand the needs of the laboratory and provide advocacy, guidance, and financial support to established CD4 testing sites and programs. This article describes and explains the procedures that must be put in place to provide reliable CD4 determinations in a variety of settings.},

abstract = {Urban areas account for two-thirds of global energy requriements while housing half of the world's population. With current projections indicating that approximately 70 percent of the world's population will live in cities by 2050, an increase in urban energy use is inevitable. In the face of this growing energy demand, developing climate-friendly urban energy solutions, while protecting the urban development that is crucial to socioeconomic progress in developing countries, is imperative.In an effort to catalyze solutions that would delink high levels of carbon-intensive energy use from urban growth, the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) of the world Bank launchched the Energy Efficient Cities Initiative in October 2008. Energy Efficient Cities: Assessment Tools and Benchmarking Practices is a product of that initiative.The analytical tools and policy insights offered in this volume extend from integrated assessments of new cities to the impacts of socioeconomic, climate, and demographic changes on existing cities, In addition, the documentation and benchmarking of a variety of low-carbon and carbon-neutral good practices provide a range of practical insights on plausible energy efficient interventions in urban sectors. This book will be of particular interest to policy makers, development practitioners, and decision makers in the private sector, as well as researchers within nongovernmental organizations and the academic community.The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAR) is a global knowledge and technical assistance trust fund administered by the World Bank that assists low and middle-income countries to increase know how and institutional capacity to achieve environmentally sustainable energy solutions for poverty reduction and economic growth.

abstract = {The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using an integrated process analytical technology (PAT) approach to determine nucleation and growth mechanisms of a dynamic naproxen (drug)-Eudragit L100 (polymer) coprecipitation process. The influence of several thermodynamically important formulation and process variables (drug/polymer ratio, alcohol, and water usages) on coprecipitation process characteristics was investigated via real-time in situ focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) monitoring and near real-time particle vision microscopy measurement. The final products were characterized by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and NIR chemical imaging microscopy. The coprecipitation nucleation induction time (t(ind) ) was measured by both FBRM trend statistics and process trajectory method, respectively. Furthermore, nucleation kinetics was evaluated based on t(ind) measurement and corresponding supersaturation ratio (S) estimated. It was found that plots of ln(t(ind) ) versus (ln(2) S)(-1) consist of two linear segments and are consistent with classical primary nucleation mechanisms. Apparently, the coprecipitation process is governed by heterogeneous primary nucleation mechanism at low S (14 ≤ S ≤ 503) and by homogeneous primary nucleation mechanism at high S (1216 ≤ S ≤ 3649). Off-line characterizations collectively supported this statement. Therefore, it demonstrated that integration real-time PAT process monitoring with first-principles modeling and off-line product characterization could enhance understanding to coprecipitation process dynamics and nucleation/growth mechanisms, which is impossible via off-line techniques alone.},

abstract = {Background Performance outcome measures are an essential component of health service improvement. Whereas hospital critical care services have established performance measures, prehospital care services have less well-established outcome measures and this has been identified as a key issue for development. Individual studies examining long-term survival and functional outcome measures have previously been used to evaluate prehospital care delivery. There is no set of standardised patient outcome measures for Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) in the UK or Air Medical Services (AMS) in Australia. The aim of this study is to document the patient outcome measures currently in use within British HEMS and Australian AMS. Methods This is an observational study analysing point prevalence of practice as of November 2009. A structured questionnaire was designed to assess the method of routine patient follow-up, and the timing and nature of applied patient outcome measures. Results Full responses were received from 17/21 (81{\%}) British services and 6/7 (86{\%}) Australian services. The overall response rate was 82{\%}. Conclusions HEMS in Britain and Australian aeromedical retrieval services do not have uniform patient outcome measures. Services tend not to follow-up patients beyond 24{\&}emsp14;h post transfer. Patient outcome data are rarely presented to an external organisation and there is no formal data comparison between surveyed services. Services are not satisfied that the data currently being collected reflects the quality of their service.},

The key to ensuring that the participating members are progressing on the right track of creating the best-in-class practice is to conduct benchmarking. Benchmarking stimulates collective learning for performance improvement that brings benefits to all participating members. However, previous research has focused mainly on supply chain benchmarking at the intra-company rather than the inter-company level. Inter-company benchmarking requires a new perspective for understanding collaborative learning amongst the participating members that encourages them to improve supply chain performance as a whole. This research aims to develop a benchmarking scheme for supply chain collaboration that links collaborative performance metrics and collaborative enablers. The proposed benchmarking scheme can be used to examine the current status of supply chain collaboration among the participating members, identify performance gaps and systematize improvement initiatives.},

@article{Simpson2011a,
abstract = {Background Performance outcome measures are an essential component of health service improvement. Whereas hospital critical care services have established performance measures, prehospital care services have less well-established outcome measures and this has been identified as a key issue for development. Individual studies examining long-term survival and functional outcome measures have previously been used to evaluate prehospital care delivery. There is no set of standardised patient outcome measures for Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) in the UK or Air Medical Services (AMS) in Australia. The aim of this study is to document the patient outcome measures currently in use within British HEMS and Australian AMS. Methods This is an observational study analysing point prevalence of practice as of November 2009. A structured questionnaire was designed to assess the method of routine patient follow-up, and the timing and nature of applied patient outcome measures. Results Full responses were received from 17/21 (81{\%}) British services and 6/7 (86{\%}) Australian services. The overall response rate was 82{\%}. Conclusions HEMS in Britain and Australian aeromedical retrieval services do not have uniform patient outcome measures. Services tend not to follow-up patients beyond 24{\&}emsp14;h post transfer. Patient outcome data are rarely presented to an external organisation and there is no formal data comparison between surveyed services. Services are not satisfied that the data currently being collected reflects the quality of their service.},

@unpublished{Watson2009a,
abstract = {In most organizations, supply chain planning is a cross-functional effort. Functional areas such as sales, marketing, finance, and operations traditionally specialize in portions of the planning activities, which results in conflicts over expectations, preferences, and priorities. We report findings from a detailed case analysis of a successful supply chain planning process. In contrast to traditional research on this area, which focuses on incentives, responsibilities, and structures, we adopt a process perspective and find that integration was achieved despite an incentive landscape that did not support it. By drawing a distinction between the incentive landscape and the planning process, we identify process as an additional mediator beyond the incentive landscape that can affect organizational outcomes. Thus, organizations may be capable of integration while different functions retain different incentives to maintain focus on their stakeholders’ needs. Through iterative coding, we identified the requisite attributes of the planning process that drive planning performance—informational, procedural, and alignment quality— but hypothesize that achieving alignment in the execution of plans can be more important than informational and procedural quality. In addition to process attributes, we also identify social elements that influenced the performance of the planning process and place the information processing attributes within a broader social and organizational context.},

abstract = {Intense competition forces companies to become involved in supply chain collaboration with their upstream and downstream partners. The key to ensuring that the participating members are progressing on the right track of creating the best-in-class practice is to conduct benchmarking. Benchmarking stimulates collective learning for performance improvement that brings benefits to all participating members. However, previous research has focused mainly on supply chain benchmarking at the intra-company rather than the inter-company level. Inter-company benchmarking requires a new perspective for understanding collaborative learning amongst the participating members that encourages them to improve supply chain performance as a whole. This research aims to develop a benchmarking scheme for supply chain collaboration that links collaborative performance metrics and collaborative enablers. The proposed benchmarking scheme can be used to examine the current status of supply chain collaboration among the participating members, identify performance gaps and systematize improvement initiatives.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using an integrated process analytical technology (PAT) approach to determine nucleation and growth mechanisms of a dynamic naproxen (drug)-Eudragit L100 (polymer) coprecipitation process. The influence of several thermodynamically important formulation and process variables (drug/polymer ratio, alcohol, and water usages) on coprecipitation process characteristics was investigated via real-time in situ focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) monitoring and near real-time particle vision microscopy measurement. The final products were characterized by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and NIR chemical imaging microscopy. The coprecipitation nucleation induction time (t(ind) ) was measured by both FBRM trend statistics and process trajectory method, respectively. Furthermore, nucleation kinetics was evaluated based on t(ind) measurement and corresponding supersaturation ratio (S) estimated. It was found that plots of ln(t(ind) ) versus (ln(2) S)(-1) consist of two linear segments and are consistent with classical primary nucleation mechanisms. Apparently, the coprecipitation process is governed by heterogeneous primary nucleation mechanism at low S (14 ≤ S ≤ 503) and by homogeneous primary nucleation mechanism at high S (1216 ≤ S ≤ 3649). Off-line characterizations collectively supported this statement. Therefore, it demonstrated that integration real-time PAT process monitoring with first-principles modeling and off-line product characterization could enhance understanding to coprecipitation process dynamics and nucleation/growth mechanisms, which is impossible via off-line techniques alone.},

abstract = {Government agencies responsible for pest animal management often assume that their views and assumptions about the benefits of control are widely shared, especially if these pests are exotics. This was certainly the case when tens of thousands of feral Asian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) were to be culled in Australia's Kakadu National Park as part of a national Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign (BTEC). Implementation of the campaign sparked considerable dispute between officials and aboriginal and non-aboriginal interests about the risks posed by buffalo relative to their value as a potential resource. Drawing upon a variety of written and oral sources relating to the era of buffalo control in Kakadu, this paper critically analyzes the way in which detriment caused by buffalo was appraised and managed under the BTEC program. In particular, the paper focuses the ways in which the BTEC program affected aboriginal people in Kakadu, who view buffalo as a source of customary and economic benefit as well as a source of change on their lands. The paper then considers what lessons can be learned from the BTEC for the development of sensible feral management objectives and strategies. It is argued that effective management of feral animals such as buffalo will require environmental managers to engage with local people and involve them in the definition and management of pest animal damage and methods of control.},

@article{Liu2010a,
abstract = {The concept of ecosystem services has shifted our paradigm of how nature matters to human societies. Instead of viewing the preservation of nature as something for which we have to sacrifice our well-being, we now perceive the environment as natural capital, one of society's important assets. But ecosystem services are becoming increasingly scarce. In order to stop this trend, the challenge is to provoke society to acknowledge the value of natural capital. Ecosystem services valuation (ESV) is the method to tackle such a challenge. ESV is the process of assessing the contributions of ecosystem services to sustainable scale, fair distribution, and efficient allocation. It is a tool that (1) provides for comparisons of natural capital to physical and human capital in regard to their contributions to human welfare; (2) monitors the quantity and quality of natural capital over time with respect to its contribution to human welfare; and (3) provides for evaluation of projects that will affect natural capital stocks. This review covers: (1) what has been done in ESV research in the last 50 years; (2) how it has been used in ecosystem management; and (3) prospects for the future. Our survey of the literature has shown that over time, there has been movement toward a more transdisciplinary approach to ESV research which is more consistent with the nature of the problems being addressed. On the other hand, the contribution of ESV to ecosystem management has not been as significant as hoped nor as clearly defined. Conclusions drawn from the review are as follows: first, ESV researchers will have to transcend disciplinary boundaries and synthesize tools, skills, and methodologies from various disciplines; second, ESV research has to become more problem-driven rather than tool-driven because ultimately the success of ESV will be judged on how well it facilitates real-world decision making and the conservation of natural capital.},

abstract = {Intense competition forces companies to become involved in supply chain collaboration with their upstream and downstream partners. The key to ensuring that the participating members are progressing on the right track of creating the best-in-class practice is to conduct benchmarking. Benchmarking stimulates collective learning for performance improvement that brings benefits to all participating members. However, previous research has focused mainly on supply chain benchmarking at the intra-company rather than the inter-company level. Inter-company benchmarking requires a new perspective for understanding collaborative learning amongst the participating members that encourages them to improve supply chain performance as a whole. This research aims to develop a benchmarking scheme for supply chain collaboration that links collaborative performance metrics and collaborative enablers. The proposed benchmarking scheme can be used to examine the current status of supply chain collaboration among the participating members, identify performance gaps and systematize improvement initiatives.},

abstract = {Government agencies responsible for pest animal management often assume that their views and assumptions about the benefits of control are widely shared, especially if these pests are exotics. This was certainly the case when tens of thousands of feral Asian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) were to be culled in Australia's Kakadu National Park as part of a national Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign (BTEC). Implementation of the campaign sparked considerable dispute between officials and aboriginal and non-aboriginal interests about the risks posed by buffalo relative to their value as a potential resource. Drawing upon a variety of written and oral sources relating to the era of buffalo control in Kakadu, this paper critically analyzes the way in which detriment caused by buffalo was appraised and managed under the BTEC program. In particular, the paper focuses the ways in which the BTEC program affected aboriginal people in Kakadu, who view buffalo as a source of customary and economic benefit as well as a source of change on their lands. The paper then considers what lessons can be learned from the BTEC for the development of sensible feral management objectives and strategies. It is argued that effective management of feral animals such as buffalo will require environmental managers to engage with local people and involve them in the definition and management of pest animal damage and methods of control.},

abstract = {Quality assurance (QA) is a systematic process to monitor and improve clinical laboratory practices. The fundamental components of a laboratory QA program include providing a functional and safe laboratory environment, trained and competent personnel, maintained equipment, adequate supplies and reagents, testing of appropriate specimens, internal monitoring of quality, accurate reporting, and external quality assessments. These components are necessary to provide accurate and precise CD4 T-cell counts, an essential test to evaluate start of and monitor effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected patients. In recent years, CD4 testing has expanded dramatically in resource-limited settings. Information on a CD4 QA program as described in this article will provide guidelines not only for clinical laboratory staff but also for managers of programs responsible for supporting CD4 testing. All agencies involved in implementing CD4 testing must understand the needs of the laboratory and provide advocacy, guidance, and financial support to established CD4 testing sites and programs. This article describes and explains the procedures that must be put in place to provide reliable CD4 determinations in a variety of settings.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using an integrated process analytical technology (PAT) approach to determine nucleation and growth mechanisms of a dynamic naproxen (drug)-Eudragit L100 (polymer) coprecipitation process. The influence of several thermodynamically important formulation and process variables (drug/polymer ratio, alcohol, and water usages) on coprecipitation process characteristics was investigated via real-time in situ focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) monitoring and near real-time particle vision microscopy measurement. The final products were characterized by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and NIR chemical imaging microscopy. The coprecipitation nucleation induction time (t(ind) ) was measured by both FBRM trend statistics and process trajectory method, respectively. Furthermore, nucleation kinetics was evaluated based on t(ind) measurement and corresponding supersaturation ratio (S) estimated. It was found that plots of ln(t(ind) ) versus (ln(2) S)(-1) consist of two linear segments and are consistent with classical primary nucleation mechanisms. Apparently, the coprecipitation process is governed by heterogeneous primary nucleation mechanism at low S (14 ≤ S ≤ 503) and by homogeneous primary nucleation mechanism at high S (1216 ≤ S ≤ 3649). Off-line characterizations collectively supported this statement. Therefore, it demonstrated that integration real-time PAT process monitoring with first-principles modeling and off-line product characterization could enhance understanding to coprecipitation process dynamics and nucleation/growth mechanisms, which is impossible via off-line techniques alone.},

abstract = {Improving the efficiency of urban energy systems is an increasingly important issue, as the energy consumption of cities has a significant effect on energy and climate policy priorities. One promising strategy for delivering these results is to increase the integration of energy services, for example through the use of combined heat and power systems. This paper introduces a tool for analyzing such integrated energy systems and demonstrates it in the case of a UK eco-town supplied with heat and power from biomass sources. We conclude that the methodology is a powerful tool for assessing potentially convoluted resource chains, a common feature of biomass energy strategies. While biomass offers a promising low-carbon solution for eco-towns such as the one studied here, we note that significant uncertainties remain in cost, carbon performance and resource availability.},

Fewer local farmers cultivate native chilies annually due to low market demand. Increasing its private use value can lead to the in-situ conservation of this crop. The objective of the paper is to evaluate the market acceptability of three native chili products: (a) chili marmalade; (b) chili cooking paste; and (c) pickled chilies. Multi-product Becker-DeGroot-Marschak experimental auctions and hedonic tests were conducted with 337 participants in La Paz and Santa Cruz. Data were analyzed using seemingly unrelated regressions. Results suggest that consumers are willing to pay price premiums of about
25–50 percent. Biodiversity conservation and improvements in farmers’ quality of life statements would not have influence on first purchase decisions but rather on repurchase decisions and therefore on consumers’ product loyalty. This in turn could lead to sustainable
agro-biodiversity conservation, centered on consumers’ purchase of these products over time.},

abstract = {Human-induced changes in the natural environment are affecting the provision of ecosystem goods and services (EGS). Land use plans rarely include the value of public ecosystem services such as climate regulation and biodiversity due to difficulties in valuing these services. In this study, we assessed total economic value for five important ecosystem goods and services under five future land-use scenarios using varying levels of costs, prices and discount rates. Results indicated that at higher discount rates normally applied to commercial activities, and assuming the current prices for goods and services, net present value (NPV) was highest for landscape management scenarios aimed at maximising agricultural production. Potential income from services such as carbon and biodiversity does not offset projected income lost from agriculture due to land-use changes. At higher discount rates, NPV was negative for the two scenarios aimed at enhancing the longer term ecological sustainability of the landscape. These results indicate that income from carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation would need to be considerably higher than current levels in order to justify focusing management of this landscape on ecological outcomes. At lower discount rates (at levels normally associated with public investments), the more ecologically appropriate ‘mosaic farming system’ had the highest NPV, indicating that this type of system might be attractive for investors interested in longer term return horizons or wider public benefits. Higher income from carbon or biodiversity, or increased return from timber by using high value tree species, could potentially make more ecologically appropriate systems profitable at higher discount rates.},

Based on a terrestrial transport infrastructure project, the objective of this paper is to quantify the potential loss of ES associated with direct and indirect impacts, and illustrate their contribution to decision-making for route options. We first quantify how much of each type of ES is generated by different land units in the absence of the infrastructure (baseline conditions). We then estimate ES loss caused by infrastructure construction in a way that discriminates among different types of ES and losses because some ES, in addition to losses that are directly proportional to the surface impacted, can show additional indirect losses associated with landscape connectivity. In addition, we illustrate how the assessment of threshold effects in particular ecosystem types that may be most sensitive to their occurrence can affect the estimation of ES loss. We compare implementation options to provide an example of how choices can be improved by assessing ES loss associated with a combination of direct and indirect impacts. This kind of analysis could be used more generally to assess development projects simply by adapting the framework of analysis to the type of project and the ecosystems concerned.},

abstract = {The concept of ecosystem services has shifted our paradigm of how nature matters to human societies. Instead of viewing the preservation of nature as something for which we have to sacrifice our well-being, we now perceive the environment as natural capital, one of society's important assets. But ecosystem services are becoming increasingly scarce. In order to stop this trend, the challenge is to provoke society to acknowledge the value of natural capital. Ecosystem services valuation (ESV) is the method to tackle such a challenge. ESV is the process of assessing the contributions of ecosystem services to sustainable scale, fair distribution, and efficient allocation. It is a tool that (1) provides for comparisons of natural capital to physical and human capital in regard to their contributions to human welfare; (2) monitors the quantity and quality of natural capital over time with respect to its contribution to human welfare; and (3) provides for evaluation of projects that will affect natural capital stocks. This review covers: (1) what has been done in ESV research in the last 50 years; (2) how it has been used in ecosystem management; and (3) prospects for the future. Our survey of the literature has shown that over time, there has been movement toward a more transdisciplinary approach to ESV research which is more consistent with the nature of the problems being addressed. On the other hand, the contribution of ESV to ecosystem management has not been as significant as hoped nor as clearly defined. Conclusions drawn from the review are as follows: first, ESV researchers will have to transcend disciplinary boundaries and synthesize tools, skills, and methodologies from various disciplines; second, ESV research has to become more problem-driven rather than tool-driven because ultimately the success of ESV will be judged on how well it facilitates real-world decision making and the conservation of natural capital.},

This lack of attention is likely the result of the complexity of the process, involving often uncoordinated efforts of a multitude of governmental and non-governmental entities over a protracted period of time with no clear start and end-point. Using information gathered from a representative subset of MPAs worldwide, this paper presents the first attempt to identify and describe the various components, and explore potential predictors of the total funds spent in the course of establishment. The thirteen MPAs studied vary in size (from <1 to >360,000 km2), location (including near- and offshore in both developed and developing countries), objectives and degree of protection. Variation in MPA start-up costs is shown to be most significantly related to both MPA size and the duration of the establishment phase. Development of a method to estimate the potential cost of establishing proposed MPAs should play a crucial role in the conservation planning process.},

abstract = {Biodiversity loss can affect ecosystem functions and services. Individual ecosystem functions generally show a positive asymptotic relationship with increasing biodiversity, suggesting that some species are redundant. However, ecosystems are managed and conserved for multiple functions, which may require greater biodiversity. Here we present an analysis of published data from grassland biodiversity experiments, and show that ecosystem multifunctionality does require greater numbers of species. We analysed each ecosystem function alone to identify species with desirable effects. We then calculated the number of species with positive effects for all possible combinations of functions. Our results show appreciable differences in the sets of species influencing different ecosystem functions, with average proportional overlap of about 0.2 to 0.5. Consequently, as more ecosystem processes were included in our analysis, more species were found to affect overall functioning. Specifically, for all of the analysed experiments, there was a positive saturating relationship between the number of ecosystem processes considered and the number of species influencing overall functioning. We conclude that because different species often influence different functions, studies focusing on individual processes in isolation will underestimate levels of biodiversity required to maintain multifunctional ecosystems.},

abstract = {Policies for promoting the in situ conservation of underutilized crop varieties include the provision of economic incentives to farmers for their market commercialization. Nevertheless, market participation could also have the counter-effect of favoring the cultivation of uniform commercial crop varieties and inducing the erosion of crop genetic diversity. The objective of this research was to identify the determinants of the in situ conservation of native chili varieties, including market participation. To this end,  128 farmers were surveyed in the Amazon rainforest region of Ucayali in Peru. The data were analyzed using probit, multinomial logit and truncated Poisson models with covariance matrix correction for cluster errors by rural community. Results suggest that participation in commercial agriculture statistically significantly increases the in situ conservation of native chili varieties; only when farmers sell their products to local retailers, but not when they supply wholesalers. In particular, this result implies that policies designed to encourage specific forms of market participation could have a positive effect on farmers’ economic well-being and simultaneously could help to achieve crop genetic diversity conservation goals.},

abstract = {While the recurrent cost of managing marine protected areas (MPAs) has been documented and estimated, there has been virtually no attempt to quantify the cost of establishing MPAs in the first place. This lack of attention is likely the result of the complexity of the process, involving often uncoordinated efforts of a multitude of governmental and non-governmental entities over a protracted period of time with no clear start and end-point. Using information gathered from a representative subset of MPAs worldwide, this paper presents the first attempt to identify and describe the various components, and explore potential predictors of the total funds spent in the course of establishment. The thirteen MPAs studied vary in size (from <1 to >360,000 km2), location (including near- and offshore in both developed and developing countries), objectives and degree of protection. Variation in MPA start-up costs is shown to be most significantly related to both MPA size and the duration of the establishment phase. Development of a method to estimate the potential cost of establishing proposed MPAs should play a crucial role in the conservation planning process.},

abstract = {Ecological economics has been repeatedly described as transdiciplinary and open to including everything from positivism to relativism. I argue for a revision and rejection of this position in favour of realism and reasoned critique. Looking into the ontological presuppositions and considering an epistemology appropriate for ecologi- cal economics to meaningfully exist requires rejecting the form of methodological pluralism which has been advocated since the start of this journal. This means being clear about the differences in our worldview (or paradigm) fromothers and being aware of the substantive failures of orthodox economics in addressing reality. This paper argues for a fundamental review of the basis uponwhich ecological economics has been founded and in so doing seeks improved clarity as to the competing and complementary epistemologies and methodologies. In part this requires establishing serious interdisciplinary research to replace superficial transdisciplinary rhetoric. The argument places the future of ecological economics firmly amongst heterodox economic schools of thought and in ideological opposition to those supporting the existing institutional structures perpetuating a false reality of theworld's social, environmental and economic systems and their operation.},

Based on a terrestrial transport infrastructure project, the objective of this paper is to quantify the potential loss of ES associated with direct and indirect impacts, and illustrate their contribution to decision-making for route options. We first quantify how much of each type of ES is generated by different land units in the absence of the infrastructure (baseline conditions). We then estimate ES loss caused by infrastructure construction in a way that discriminates among different types of ES and losses because some ES, in addition to losses that are directly proportional to the surface impacted, can show additional indirect losses associated with landscape connectivity. In addition, we illustrate how the assessment of threshold effects in particular ecosystem types that may be most sensitive to their occurrence can affect the estimation of ES loss. We compare implementation options to provide an example of how choices can be improved by assessing ES loss associated with a combination of direct and indirect impacts. This kind of analysis could be used more generally to assess development projects simply by adapting the framework of analysis to the type of project and the ecosystems concerned.},

abstract = {Native chilies (Capsicum spp.) are currently underutilized in Bolivia, one of this crop’s centers of diversity. Fewer local farmers cultivate native chilies annually due to low market demand. Increasing its private use value can lead to the in-situ conservation of this crop. The objective of the paper is to evaluate the market acceptability of three native chili products: (a) chili marmalade; (b) chili cooking paste; and (c) pickled chilies. Multi-product Becker-DeGroot-Marschak experimental auctions and hedonic tests were conducted with 337 participants in La Paz and Santa Cruz. Data were analyzed using seemingly unrelated regressions. Results suggest that consumers are willing to pay price premiums of about
25–50 percent. Biodiversity conservation and improvements in farmers’ quality of life statements would not have influence on first purchase decisions but rather on repurchase decisions and therefore on consumers’ product loyalty. This in turn could lead to sustainable
agro-biodiversity conservation, centered on consumers’ purchase of these products over time.},

abstract = {Human-induced changes in the natural environment are affecting the provision of ecosystem goods and services (EGS). Land use plans rarely include the value of public ecosystem services such as climate regulation and biodiversity due to difficulties in valuing these services. In this study, we assessed total economic value for five important ecosystem goods and services under five future land-use scenarios using varying levels of costs, prices and discount rates. Results indicated that at higher discount rates normally applied to commercial activities, and assuming the current prices for goods and services, net present value (NPV) was highest for landscape management scenarios aimed at maximising agricultural production. Potential income from services such as carbon and biodiversity does not offset projected income lost from agriculture due to land-use changes. At higher discount rates, NPV was negative for the two scenarios aimed at enhancing the longer term ecological sustainability of the landscape. These results indicate that income from carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation would need to be considerably higher than current levels in order to justify focusing management of this landscape on ecological outcomes. At lower discount rates (at levels normally associated with public investments), the more ecologically appropriate ‘mosaic farming system’ had the highest NPV, indicating that this type of system might be attractive for investors interested in longer term return horizons or wider public benefits. Higher income from carbon or biodiversity, or increased return from timber by using high value tree species, could potentially make more ecologically appropriate systems profitable at higher discount rates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is common in cirrhosis but its pathophysiologic basis remains undefined. We evaluated whether the presence of MHE was associated with severity of liver disease, ammonia levels or the presence of inflammation and assessed factors determining neuropsychological deterioration accompanying induction of hyperammonemia. METHODS: Eighty four cirrhotics were studied. A neuropsychological test battery was performed and blood taken for ammonia, WCC, CRP, nitrate/nitrite, IL-6 and amino acids, before and after, induction of hyperammonemia by administration of a solution mimicking the amino acid composition of haemoglobin (60) or placebo (24). RESULTS: The presence and severity of MHE were independent of severity of liver disease and ammonia concentration but markers of inflammation were significantly higher in those with MHE compared with those without. Induction of hyperammonemia produced deterioration in one or more neuropsychological tests by > or =1 SD in 73.3{\%}. This was independent of the magnitude of change in plasma ammonia and severity of liver disease but was significantly greater in those with more marked inflammation. CONCLUSION: Our data show that inflammation is an important determinant of the presence and severity of MHE. The change in neuropsychological function following induced hyperammonemia is greater in those with more severe inflammation.},

@article{Norenberg1998,
abstract = {While the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) remains elusive, there is considerable evidence pointing to a key role of ammonia-induced dysfunction of astrocytes in this condition. Deficits in the ability of astrocytes to take up glutamate from the extracellular space may lead to abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission. Furthermore, excessive stimulation of neuronal and glial glutamate receptors by elevated extracellular levels of glutamate may lead to excitotoxicity and greater glial dysfunction. Ammonia also causes upregulation of astroglial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) which is associated with increased production of neurosteroids. These neurosteroids have potent positive modulatory effects on the neuronal GABA(A) receptor which, combined with an ammonia-induced astroglial defect in GABA uptake, may result in enhanced GABAergic tone. Brain edema, associated with fulminant hepatic failure, may also result from astroglial abnormalities as the edema appears to be principally caused by swelling of these cells. Increased amounts of glutamine in astrocytes resulting from elevated brain ammonia levels may be a factor in this swelling. Other osmolytes such as glutathione may also be involved. Glial swelling may also result from NH4+ - and K+ -mediated membrane depolarization as well as by the actions of PBR agonists and neurosteroids. These findings show that an ammonia-induced gliopathy is a major factor in the pathogenesis of HE.},

Significant reductions in mean Cho/Cr and elevations in mean Glx/Cr were observed in the patient population, which correlated with the severity of CHE. There were significant regional variations in these metabolite ratios with the mean Cho/Cr lowest in the occipital cortex and the mean Glx/Cr highest in the basal ganglia.

Therefore we investigated the effects of intravenous injection of F and S in dogs with chronic HE 8 to 12 weeks after placement of a portocaval shunt and 40{\%} hepatectomy (n=7), compared to sham-operated pair-fed controls (n=7). The HE dogs had hyperammonemia (298 +/- 48 microM v 33 +/- 3 before surgery (mean +/- SEM)) and signs of HE at the start of the experiments (0.9 +/- 0.1 (scale 0-4)). Three (S3) and 8 (S8) mg/kg of S resulted in a significant improvement of encephalopathy (grade 0.9 +/- 0.2 immediately before v 0.5 +/- 0.1 after injection (S3) and 0.7 +/- 0.1 v 0.3 +/- 0.1 (S8)) and increase in mean dominant frequency of the EEG (MDF; 9.1 +/- 0.7 Hz v 11.1 +/- 0.3 (S3) and 8.9 +/- 0.5 v 11.0 +/- 0.3 (S8)) in HE dogs, whereas 15 mg/kg of S, 3 and 8 mg/kg of F, and the vehicle had no significant effects. The efficacy of S in these dogs is consistent with an increased GABAergic tone in the pathogenesis of chronic HE. The lack of effects of F makes a role for endogenous benzodiazepines herein unlikely.},

TAA treatment increased by 33{\%} Vmax for high affinity, low capacity alpha-KG uptake, without influencing its Km. The increase of the uptake capacity for alpha-KG may represent a response of the GLUergic nerve terminals to the decreased cerebral alpha-KG content, which during HE is associated with depressed activity of pyruvate carboxylase, an enzyme that replenishes alpha-KG in astrocytes. The result is thus consistent with the notion that HE affects the astroglial control of GLUergic neurotransmission. The Km and Vmax for the low affinity, high capacity GLN uptake was not affected by TAA treatment.},

abstract = {Glutamine metabolism is generally regarded as proceeding via glutaminase-catalyzed hydrolysis to glutamate and ammonia, followed by conversion of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase or by a glutamate-linked aminotransferase (transaminase). However, another pathway exists for the conversion of glutamine to alpha-ketoglutarate that is often overlooked, but is widely distributed in nature. This pathway, referred to as the glutaminase II pathway, consists of a glutamine transaminase coupled to omega-amidase. Transamination of glutamine results in formation of the corresponding alpha-keto acid, namely, alpha-ketoglutaramate (KGM). KGM is hydrolyzed by omega-amidase to alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia. The net glutaminase II reaction is: L - Glutamine + alpha - keto acid + H2O --> alpha - ketoglutarate + L - amino acid + ammonia. In this mini-review the biochemical importance of the glutaminase II pathway is summarized, with emphasis on the key component KGM. Forty years ago it was noted that the concentration of KGM is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and that the level of KGM in the CSF correlates well with the degree of encephalopathy. In more recent work, we have shown that KGM is markedly elevated in the urine of patients with inborn errors of the urea cycle. It is suggested that KGM may be a useful biomarker for many hyperammonemic diseases including hepatic encephalopathy, inborn errors of the urea cycle, citrin deficiency and lysinuric protein intolerance.},

Just inject capital into an economy and it would grow. As the economy grew, you could then re-invest the growth increment as new capital and make the economy grow exponentially. Social development would follow. Originally, to get things started, capital came from savings, from confiscation, or from foreign aid or investment, but later out of the national growth increment itself. Capital embodied technology, the source of its power. Capital was magic stuff, but scarce. It all seemed convincing at the time. ...},

abstract = {Biodiversity loss can affect ecosystem functions and services. Individual ecosystem functions generally show a positive asymptotic relationship with increasing biodiversity, suggesting that some species are redundant. However, ecosystems are managed and conserved for multiple functions, which may require greater biodiversity. Here we present an analysis of published data from grassland biodiversity experiments, and show that ecosystem multifunctionality does require greater numbers of species. We analysed each ecosystem function alone to identify species with desirable effects. We then calculated the number of species with positive effects for all possible combinations of functions. Our results show appreciable differences in the sets of species influencing different ecosystem functions, with average proportional overlap of about 0.2 to 0.5. Consequently, as more ecosystem processes were included in our analysis, more species were found to affect overall functioning. Specifically, for all of the analysed experiments, there was a positive saturating relationship between the number of ecosystem processes considered and the number of species influencing overall functioning. We conclude that because different species often influence different functions, studies focusing on individual processes in isolation will underestimate levels of biodiversity required to maintain multifunctional ecosystems.},

I argue for a revision and rejection of this position in favour of realism and reasoned critique. Looking into the ontological presuppositions and considering an epistemology appropriate for ecologi- cal economics to meaningfully exist requires rejecting the form of methodological pluralism which has been advocated since the start of this journal. This means being clear about the differences in our worldview (or paradigm) fromothers and being aware of the substantive failures of orthodox economics in addressing reality. This paper argues for a fundamental review of the basis uponwhich ecological economics has been founded and in so doing seeks improved clarity as to the competing and complementary epistemologies and methodologies. In part this requires establishing serious interdisciplinary research to replace superficial transdisciplinary rhetoric. The argument places the future of ecological economics firmly amongst heterodox economic schools of thought and in ideological opposition to those supporting the existing institutional structures perpetuating a false reality of theworld's social, environmental and economic systems and their operation.},

abstract = {Brain edema is a critical component of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) associated with acute liver failure and such edema appears to be principally due to astrocyte swelling (cytotoxic edema). Ammonia is believed to represent a major factor responsible for astrocyte swelling, although the mechanisms by which ammonia causes such swelling are not completely understood. Recent studies have implicated potential role of oxidative stress, and the mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT). While it is not known how oxidative stress and the mPT cause astrocyte swelling, it is reasonable to suggest that these events may affect one or more plasma membrane proteins involved in water and ion homeostasis in astrocytes. One such protein strongly implicated in brain edema in other neurological conditions is the water channel protein aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), which is abundantly expressed in astrocytes. This article summarizes the potential role of AQP-4 in brain edema in in vivo models of HE, as well as in ammonia-induced cell swelling in cultured astrocytes. The involvement of AQP-4 in the effects of manganese, another toxin implicated in HE, will also be discussed.},

abstract = {Benzodiazepine receptor ligands are suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis  of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Accumulation of these ligands in brain was suggested to explain in part the notion of"increased GABAergic tone," the rational for which arose initially from reports of a beneficial effect of the selective benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil in HE patients. It was suggested on the basis of the effect of flumazenil in human HE that liver failure may result in alterations of the density and/or affinity of the benzodiazepine-associated GABA-A receptor site. Subsequent controlled-clinical trials showed that fumazenil had a transient beneficial effect in only a subpopulation of HE patients. In contrast to the antagonists, partial inverse agonists of the benzodiazepine receptor have unequivocal beneficial effects on behavioral and electro-physiological performance in all experimental models of HE studied so far. Benzodiazepine-associated GABA-A receptors have consistently been demonstrated to be unaltered in both human and experimental HE. Contrary to initial reports, the so-called "endogenous benzodiazepines" do not appear to be significantly related to the pathogenesis of HE. On the other hand, nonbenzodiazepine GABA-A receptor complex modulators, such as neuro-steroids, recently identified in brain in human and experimental HE, may provide a new mechanistic basis for this disorder and lead to novel treatments for human HE.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in  patients with liver disorders and a wide range of rodent models of HE have been described to facilitate studies into the pathogenesis and treatment of HE. However, it is widely acknowledged that no individual model perfectly mimics human HE and there is a particular need for spontaneous, larger animal models. One common congenital abnormality in dogs is the portosystemic shunt (cPSS) which causes clinical signs that are similar to human HE such as ataxia, disorientation, lethargy and occasionally coma. As inflammation has recently been shown to be associated with HE in humans, we hypothesised that inflammation would similarly be associated with HE in dogs with cPSS. To examine this hypothesis we measured C-reactive protein (CRP) in 30 healthy dogs, 19 dogs with a cPSS and no HE and 27 dogs with a cPSS and overt HE. There was a significant difference in CRP concentration between healthy dogs and dogs with HE (p < 0.001) and between dogs with HE and without HE (p < 0.05). The novel finding that there is an association between inflammation and canine HE strengthens the concept that HE in dogs with cPSS shares a similar pathogenesis to humans with HE. Consequently, dogs with a cPSS may be a good spontaneous model of human HE in which to further examine the role of inflammation and development of HE.},

abstract = {Induction of hyperammonaemia with nitrogen challenge in man can be used to study  the pathogenesis and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy complicating cirrhosis. Initially 20 g of glutamine was given orally as a flavored solution which resulted in doubling of blood ammonia concentration and this was associated with a deterioration in performance of the choice reaction time. The effect could have been due to a direct effect of glutamine rather than the ammonia generated so in subsequent experiments a glutamine free mixture of amino acids resembling the composition of haemoglobin was used (gastrointestinal bleeding is a known precipitant of hepatic encephalopathy). In Child grade B and C patients, 2-3 h after 54 g, slowing of the EEG was observed. The cerebral effects of induced hyperammonaemia were studied with diffusion weighted imaging and MR spectroscopy after giving 54 g of a mixture of threonine, serine and glycine when apparent diffusion coefficient increased. Also the change in ammonia levels correlated with the change in cerebral glutamine levels (r = 0.78, p = 0.002) suggesting intra cerebral formation of glutamine from ammonia and this may have accounted for the fall in cerebral myoinositol concentrations observed. Finally a colonic source for ammonia was confirmed by administering urea using colon coated capsules when ammonia concentrations slowly increased from 5 h after administration and rapidly after 10 h. In two patients the hyperammonaemia was ameliorated by pre treatment with Rifaximin 1200 mg per day for 1 week. Nitrogen challenge studies are thus a valuable model for studying new treatments for hepatic encephalopathy without the need to simultaneously treat precipitating factors.},

abstract = {Infection and inflammation have been associated with the development of delirium  for many centuries and there is a rapidly growing evidence base supporting the role of inflammation in exacerbating the neurological manifestations of both acute and chronic liver failure. Inflammation in the context of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) can arise directly within the brain itself resulting in astrocytic, microglial and neuronal dysfunction, impacting on the development of 'brain failure'. Inflammation may also develop systemically and indirectly influence brain function. Systemic inflammation develops following liver injury, resulting in hyperammonemia and a 'cytotoxic soup' of pro-inflammatory mediators which are released into the circulation and modulate the impact of ammonia on the brain. The aim of this review is to summarise the current evidence base supporting the synergistic role of systemic inflammation and hyperammonemia in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. Systemic inflammation and ammonia induce neutrophil degranulation and release reactive oxygen species into the peripheral circulation that may ultimately cross the blood brain barrier. Circulating endotoxin arising from the gut (bacterial translocation), superimposed sepsis, and hyperammonemia upregulate the expression of microbial pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors. The early recognition and management of systemic inflammation may not only facilitate improved outcomes in HE but supports the development of novel therapeutic strategies that reduce circulating endotoxemia and immune cell dysfunction.},

Controversy exists about the role of glutamine accumulation as a causal factor in HE. Glutamine formation contributes to detoxify ammonia, whereby anaplerotic mechanisms in the astrocytes have to be sufficient to replenish Krebs cycle intermediates. The application of ex vivo high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy permits direct measurements of metabolites and different metabolic pathways. Ex vivo (13)C-NMR studies in experimental animal models of acute and chronic HE have provided new insights. In an experimental rat model of ALF, (13)C isotopomer analysis of glucose metabolism showed that alterations of glucose flux through astrocytic pyruvate carboxylase might be linked to the pathogenesis of ALF as a limited anaplerotic flux in the brain, but not in the muscle, correlates with the development of brain edema. Moreover, (13)C-NMR data from a rat model of mild HE demonstrated relative differences in the pathway of glucose through pyruvate carboxylase in thalamus compared to frontal cortex, which might explain the vulnerability of this brain region compared to thalamus. These findings further support that glutamine accumulation might be not the primary cause of neurological symptoms in HE, and show that anaplerotic mechanisms could be essential for ammonia detoxification in HE.},

Cell culture studies reveal a positive synergistic effect of ammonia and pro-inflammatory cytokines on the expression of proteins involved in glutamate homeostasis and in oxidative/nitrosative stress. Proinflammatory cytokines have the capacity to alter blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and preliminary studies suggest that the presence of infection in ALF results in rupture of the BBB and vasogenic brain edema.

abstract = {Despite enormous strides in our understanding of human disease, the precise mechanisms of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a potential long-term complication of liver failure, are still unclear. Brain serotonin, a neurotransmitter with widespread distribution in the CNS, plays a role in the regulation of a wide range of physiological behaviors and functions. In addition, it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several pathological processes, including HE. This work reviews the relationship between brain serotonergic dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients and experimental animals. The existing changes in the synthesis, metabolism, storage, and release of neuronal serotonin in HE point to a serotonergic synaptic deficit in this condition. Given the established role of the brain serotonergic system in the regulation of sleep, circadian rhythmicity, and locomotion, selective alterations of this system could be an important part of the neurophysiological background responsible for the behavioral changes in rats with portacaval anastomosis and may contribute to the pathogenesis of HE in cirrhotic patients. The findings that serotoninergic turnover is exquisitely and selectively sensitive to the degree of porto-systemic shunting and hyperammonemia suggest a role for serotonin in early neuropsychiatric symptoms of HE. Pharmacological manipulation of the brain serotonergic system may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of HE in cirrhotic patients.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy is a condition of reduced brain functioning in which both  blood flow and brain energy metabolism declined. It is not known whether blood flow or metabolism is the primary limiting factor of brain function in this condition. We used calculations of mitochondrial oxygen tension to choose between cause and effect in three groups of volunteers, including healthy control subjects (HC), patients with cirrhosis of the liver without hepatic encephalopathy (CL), and patients with cirrhosis with acute hepatic encephalopathy. Compared to HC subjects, blood flow and energy metabolism had declined in all gray matter regions of the brain in patients with HE but not significantly in patients with CL. Analysis of flow-metabolism coupling indicated that blood flow declined in HE as a consequence of reduced brain energy metabolism implied by the calculation of increased mitochondrial oxygen tensions that patients with HE were unable to utilize. We ascribe the inability to use the delivered oxygen of patients with HE to a specific inhibition associated with oxidative metabolism in mitochondria.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric manifestation of acute and chronic liver failure. Ammonia plays a key role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy by inducing astrocyte swelling and/or sensitizing astrocytes to swelling by a heterogeneous panel of precipitating factors and conditions. Whereas astrocyte swelling in acute liver failure contributes to a clinically overt brain edema, a low grade glial edema without clinically overt brain edema is observed in hepatic encephalopathy in liver cirrhosis. Astrocyte swelling produces reactive oxygen and nitrogen oxide species (ROS/RNOS), which again increase astrocyte swelling, thereby creating a self-amplifying signaling loop. Astroglial swelling and ROS/RNOS increase protein tyrosine nitration and may account for neurotoxic effects of ammonia and other precipitants of hepatic encephalopathy. Recently, RNA oxidation and an increase of free intracellular zinc ([Zn(2+)](i)) were identified as further consequences of astrocyte swelling and ROS/RNOS production. An elevation of [Zn(2+)](i) mediates mRNA expression of metallothionein and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) induced by hypoosmotic astrocyte swelling. Further, Zn(2+) mediates RNA oxidation in ammonia-treated astrocytes. In the brain of hyperammonemic rats oxidized RNA localizes in part to perivascular astrocyte processes and to postsynaptic dendritic spines. RNA oxidation may impair postsynaptic protein synthesis, which is critically involved in learning and memory consolidation. RNA oxidation offers a novel explanation for multiple disturbances of neurotransmitter systems and gene expression and the cognitive deficits observed in hepatic encephalopathy.},

abstract = {Memory dysfunction is reported in cirrhotics. The aim of this paper was to increase insight into memory function of cirrhotic patients without overt hepatic encephalopathy. Eighty-six consecutive cirrhotics without overt hepatic encephalopathy (aged 54+/-10 yr., mean+/-s.d.) and 28 controls (52+/-10 yr.) with comparable education level were enrolled. Seventeen patients were class A, 55 class B, 14 class C according to Child-Pugh classification; 29 had alcoholic cirrhosis. The presence of subclinical signs of central nervous system dysfunction were assessed by Number Connection Test (NCT) and quantified EEG analysis. Memory scanning was evaluated by reaction times (RTs) in the Sternberg paradigm. MANOVA analysis showed that RTs were higher (F1,99=11, p<0.01) and time outs (TOs) more frequent (F1,110=10, p<0.01) in cirrhotics than in controls, whereas button press errors (BPEs) did not differ significantly (F1,110=2, p=n.s.). In cirrhotics, an interaction Child-Pugh class x memory set size was found (F2,146=4, p<0.05), showing exceedingly delayed RTs with greater memory set size in class C patients. Patients with altered NCT had significantly prolonged RTs (F1,71=4, p<0.05) and more TOs (F1,82=11, p<0.01) than patients with normal NCT. Cirrhotics with altered EEG had significantly prolonged RTs (F2,70=6, p<0.01). RTs were found to be correlated to alpha relative power (r=-0.4, p<0.01) and theta relative power (r=0.4, p<0.01). In conclusion, cirrhotics without over encephalopathy, but with NCT or EEG alterations, perform a computerized digit recognition task more slowly and with higher TOs than cirrhotic patients with normal NCT or EEG. In severe liver insufficiency (class C cirrhotics) also an impairment of memory scanning was detected. Sternberg test performance correlates with NCT and quantitative EEG parameters.},

abstract = {The treatment of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is complex and therapeutic regimens  vary according to the acuity of presentation and the goals of therapy. Most treatments for HE rely on manipulating the intestinal milieu and therefore antibiotics that act on the gut form a key treatment strategy. Prominent antibiotics studied in HE are neomycin, metronidazole, vancomycin and rifaximin. For the management of the acute episode, all antibiotics have been tested. However the limited numbers studied, adverse effects (neomycin oto- and nephrotoxicity, metronidazole neurotoxicity) and potential for resistance emergence (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus) has limited the use of most antibiotics, apart from rifaximin which has the greatest evidence base. Rifaximin has also demonstrated, in conjunction with lactulose, to prevent overt HE recurrence in a multi-center, randomized trial. Despite its cost in the US, rifaximin may prove cost-saving by preventing hospitalizations for overt HE. In minimal/covert HE, rifaximin is the only systematically studied antibiotic. Rifaximin showed improvement in cognition, inflammation, quality-of-life and driving simulator performance but cost-analysis does not favor its use at the current time. Antibiotics, especially rifaximin, have a definite role in the management across the spectrum of HE.},

A meta-analysis of randomized trials showed that, compared with placebo or no intervention, non-absorbable disaccharides have beneficial effects on HE manifestations and prevention of HE episodes. The addition of rifaximin to non-absorbable disaccharides versus rifaximin alone was more beneficial than non-absorbable disaccharides used alone on both outcome measures. Likewise, a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials found that oral BCAA supplements have beneficial effects on manifestations of HE compared with control supplements. The effect was found in a variety of clinical settings. No convincing effects of intravenous BCAA for episodic HE were identified. In conclusion, evidence-based treatment recommendations for patients with HE should include non-absorbable disaccharides combined with rifaximin or BCAA. Additional evidence is needed to evaluate the effect of combining all three interventions.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in  patients with liver disorders and a wide range of rodent models of HE have been described to facilitate studies into the pathogenesis and treatment of HE. However, it is widely acknowledged that no individual model perfectly mimics human HE and there is a particular need for spontaneous, larger animal models. One common congenital abnormality in dogs is the portosystemic shunt (cPSS) which causes clinical signs that are similar to human HE such as ataxia, disorientation, lethargy and occasionally coma. As inflammation has recently been shown to be associated with HE in humans, we hypothesised that inflammation would similarly be associated with HE in dogs with cPSS. To examine this hypothesis we measured C-reactive protein (CRP) in 30 healthy dogs, 19 dogs with a cPSS and no HE and 27 dogs with a cPSS and overt HE. There was a significant difference in CRP concentration between healthy dogs and dogs with HE (p < 0.001) and between dogs with HE and without HE (p < 0.05). The novel finding that there is an association between inflammation and canine HE strengthens the concept that HE in dogs with cPSS shares a similar pathogenesis to humans with HE. Consequently, dogs with a cPSS may be a good spontaneous model of human HE in which to further examine the role of inflammation and development of HE.},

Acute HE in the thioacetamide (TAA) model caused a 54 {\%} decrease of mGSH content in the rat prefrontal cortex (pfc), but not in the striatum (str), nor did it affect the GSH content in the pfc or str homogenate. In the pfc, treatment with L- histidine (His), which is known to alleviate ONS-related symptoms in HE animals, attenuated the decrease of mGSH, and increased the GSH content in pfc and str homogenates and pfc microdialysates of control animals. His increased the expression of mRNA coding for the GSH synthesizing enzyme, glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) and decreased that of the GSH-degrading enzyme gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gammaGT). The results suggest that the decrease of mGSH may be an important contributing factor to mitochondrial dysfunction in HE, and delineate a new mechanistic aspect of the therapeutic potential of His in HE.},

A major cause of pallidal hyperintensity on T1-weighted MRI is manganese deposition; chronic manganese intoxication in the absence of liver disease results in pallidal MR signal hyperintensity, in extrapyramidal symptoms and in selective effects on the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system in basal ganglia. Direct measurements in globus pallidus obtained at autopsy from patients with chronic liver disease who died in hepatic coma reveal 2 to 7-fold increases of pallidal manganese and a concomitant loss of dopamine D2 binding sites. Liver transplantation results in normalization of pallidal MR signals and of blood manganese levels. These findings suggest that (1) pallidal MR signal hyperintensity in patients with chronic liver disease is the result of manganese deposition and (2) alterations of dopaminergic function due to the toxic effects of manganese may contribute to the extrapyramidal symptoms in these patients.},

abstract = {Awareness of previous hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and compliance with treatment can probably reduce HE recurrence. The aim of this study was to assess the degree of awareness of previous HE and its treatment in a group of cirrhotic patients and their caregivers. Thirty-five cirrhotic patients with a history of HE and their caregivers (n = 31) were enrolled. Patients underwent evaluation of HE (clinical, psychometry and electroencephalography), quality of life (SF36 questionnaire), and awareness of HE/treatment on an ad hoc questionnaire (QAE). Caregivers underwent the QAE plus the Caregiver Burden Inventory. On the day of study, 7 patients were unimpaired, 8 had minimal and 20 low-grade overt HE. Of the patients, 37 {\%} were aware of previous HE, 6 {\%} of being on treatment and 6 {\%} understood treatment effects. Of the caregivers, 48 {\%} were aware of previous HE, 6 {\%} of their relative being on treatment and 6 {\%} understood treatment effects. Significant correlations were observed between neuropsychiatric status/linear HE indices and both the patients' quality of life and the caregivers' burden. In conclusion, HE awareness was poor in both patients and caregivers, most likely in relation to insufficient/inadequate provision of information.},

abstract = {While it is consensus that minimal hepatic encephalopathy (mHE) has significant impact on a patient's daily living, and thus should be diagnosed and treated, there is no consensus about the optimal diagnostic tools. At present the most frequently used psychometric methods for diagnosing minimal hepatic encephalopathy are the Inhibitory Control Test and the Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score PHES. Another frequently used method is Critical Flicker Frequency. The PHES and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status have been recommended for diagnosing mHE by a working party commissioned by the International Society for Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism. Recently the Continuous Reaction Time Test, which has been used in the 1980ies, has gained new interest. Today, no data are available that allow to decide which of these methods is the most appropriate. In fact, even basic information such as dependence on age, sex and education or influence of diseases that frequently accompany liver cirrhosis upon test results is missing for most of them. Future studies must address these questions to improve diagnosis of mHE.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of chronic alcoholism and patients show neurological symptoms ranging from mild cognitive dysfunction to coma and death. The HE brain is characterized by glial changes, including microglial activation, but the exact pathogenesis of HE is poorly understood. During a study investigating cell proliferation in the subventricular zone of chronic alcoholics, a single case with widespread proliferation throughout their adjacent grey and white matter was noted. This case also had concomitant HE raising the possibility that glial proliferation might be a pathological feature of the disease. In order to explore this possibility fixed postmortem human brain tissue from chronic alcoholics with cirrhosis and HE (n = 9), alcoholics without HE (n = 4) and controls (n = 4) were examined using immunohistochemistry and cytokine assays. In total, 4/9 HE cases had PCNA- and a second proliferative marker, Ki-67-positive cells throughout their brain and these cells co-stained with the microglial marker, Iba1. These cases were termed 'proliferative HE' (pHE). The microglia in pHEs displayed an activated morphology with hypertrophied cell bodies and short, thickened processes. In contrast, the microglia in white matter regions of the non-proliferative HE cases were less activated and appeared dystrophic. pHEs were also characterized by higher interleukin-6 levels and a slightly higher neuronal density . These findings suggest that microglial proliferation may form part of an early neuroprotective response in HE that ultimately fails to halt the course of the disease because underlying etiological factors such as high cerebral ammonia and systemic inflammation remain.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy is a severe neuropathological condition arising secondary  to liver failure. The pathogenesis is not well understood; however, hyperammonemia is considered to be one causative factor. Hyperammonemia has been suggested to inhibit tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity, thus affecting energy metabolism. Furthermore, it has been suggested that catabolism of the branched-chain amino acid isoleucine may help curb the effect of hyperammonemia by by-passing the TCA cycle block as well as providing the carbon skeleton for glutamate and glutamine synthesis thus fixating ammonia. Here we present novel results describing [U-(13)C]isoleucine metabolism in muscle and brain analyzed by mass spectrometry in bile duct ligated rats, a model of chronic hepatic encephalopathy, and discuss them in relation to previously published results from neural cell cultures. The metabolism of [U-(13)C]isoleucine in muscle tissue was about five times higher than that in the brain which, in turn, was lower than in corresponding cell cultures. However, synthesis of glutamate and glutamine was supported by catabolism of isoleucine. In rat brain, differential labeling patterns in glutamate and glutamine suggest that isoleucine may primarily be metabolized in the astrocytic compartment which is in accordance with previous findings in neural cell cultures. Lastly, in rat brain the labeling patterns of glutamate, aspartate and GABA do not suggest any significant inhibition by ammonia of TCA cycle activity which corresponds well to findings in neural cell cultures. Branched-chain amino acids including isoleucine are used for treating hepatic encephalopathy and the present findings shed light on the possible mechanism involved. The low turn-over of isoleucine in rat brain suggests that this amino acid does not serve the role of providing metabolites pertinent to TCA cycle function and hence energy formation as well as the necessary carbon skeleton for subsequent ammonia fixation in hyperammonemia. The higher metabolism of isoleucine in muscle could, however, contribute to ammonia fixation and thus likely be of value in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.},

abstract = {There is a strong relationship between liver and gut; while the portal venous system receives blood from the gut, and its contents may affect liver functions, liver in turn, affects intestinal functions through bile secretion. There is robust evidence that the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is linked to alterations in gut microbiota and their by-products such as ammonia, indoles, oxindoles, endotoxins, etc. In the setting of intestinal barrier and immune dysfunction, these by-products are involved in the pathogenesis of complications of liver cirrhosis including HE and systemic inflammation plays an important role. Prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics may exhibit efficacy in the treatment of HE by modulating the gut flora. They improve derangement in flora by decreasing the counts of pathogenic bacteria and thus improving the endotoxemia, HE and the liver disease. Current evidence suggest that the trials evaluating the role of probiotics in the treatment of HE are of not high quality and all trials had high risk of bias and high risk of random errors. Therefore, the use of probiotics for patients with HE cannot be currently recommended. Further RCTs are required. This review summarizes the main literature findings about the relationships between gut flora and HE, both in terms of the pathogenesis and the treatment of HE.},

However, overconfidence also leads to faulty assessments, unrealistic expectations and hazardous decisions, so it remains a puzzle how such a false belief could evolve or remain stable in a population of competing strategies that include accurate, unbiased beliefs. Here we present an evolutionary model showing that, counterintuitively, overconfidence maximizes individual fitness and populations tend to become overconfident, as long as benefits from contested resources are sufficiently large compared with the cost of competition. In contrast, unbiased strategies are only stable under limited conditions. This may help to explain why overconfidence remains prevalent today, even if it contributes to market bubbles, financial collapses, policy failures, and costly wars.},

abstract = {Results of neuropathologic, spectroscopic, and neurochemical studies continue to  confirm a major role for ammonia in the pathogenesis of the central nervous system complications of both acute and chronic liver failure. Damage to astrocytes characterized by cell swelling (acute liver failure) or Alzheimer Type II astrocytosis (chronic liver failure) can be readily reproduced by acute or chronic exposure of these cells in vitro to pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of ammonia. Furthermore, exposure of the brain or cultured astrocytes to ammonia results in similar alterations in expression of genes coding for key astrocytic proteins. Such proteins include the structural glial fibrillary acidic protein, glutamate transporters, and peripheral-type (mitochondrial) benzodiazepine receptors. Brain-blood ammonia concentration ratios (normally of the order of 2) are increased up to fourfold in liver failure and arterial blood ammonia concentrations are good predictors of cerebral herniation in patients with acute liver failure. Studies using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients with chronic liver failure reveal a positive correlation between the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms and brain concentrations of the brain ammonia-detoxification product glutamine. Increased intracellular glutamine may be a contributory cause of brain edema in hyperammonemia. Positron emission tomography studies using 13HN3 provide evidence of increased blood-brain ammonia transfer and brain ammonia utilization rates in patients with chronic liver failure. In addition to the use of nonabsorbable disaccharides and antibiotics to reduce gut ammonia production, new approaches to the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy by lowering of brain ammonia include the use of L-ornithine-L-aspartate and mild hypothermia.},

Ammonia readily enters brain cells from the blood, and toxic effects of ammonia on brain metabolism and neurotransmission are believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of HE. It has, however, been a matter of great controversy whether backflux of unmetabolized ammonia (NH(3) + NH(4) (+)) from brain cells to the blood occurs in man. In the present analysis of data from a dynamic PET study of brain (13)N-ammonia metabolism in healthy subjects and cirrhotic patients with and without HE, we provide the first unambiguous evidence for backflux of ammonia from brain cells to the blood in man. The high temporal and spatial resolution of modern PET technology was employed to distinguish between unidirectional blood-brain transport of ammonia and subsequent metabolism of the ammonia in the brain. In all 16 subjects, clearance of the unidirectional transport of (13)N-ammonia from the blood to brain cells (K(1)) was higher than the metabolic clearance of (13)N-ammonia from the blood (K(met)=K(1) k(3)/(k(2)+k(3)). This can only be explained by backflux (k(2)) of ammonia from brain cells to the blood. In conclusion, backflux of ammonia from the brain to the blood does indeed occur in both healthy subjects and cirrhotic patients with and without hepatic encephalopathy.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is clinically characterized by a large variety of symptoms including motor symptoms, cognitive deficits, as well as changes in the level of alertness up to hepatic coma. A number of pathological processes affecting glial and neuronal function have been identified, including hyper-ammonia, changes within the excitatory and inhibitory transmitter systems, as well as osmolytic changes with consecutive cell swelling. One explanation how these pathological processes result in neurological deficits in HE is the concept of pathologically synchronized oscillations within and between relevant brain regions. A number of studies suggest that the cognitive deficits and the reduced level of alertness in patients with HE can be attributed to a significantly slowed and pathologically synchronized spontaneous oscillatory brain activity, depending on the grade of HE. Moreover, HE motor symptoms, like postural tremor called"mini asterixis," have recently been shown to be associated with abnormal thalamo-cortical and cortico-muscular synchronization. Indirect evidence exists from studies of processing and recognition of flicker stimuli that in HE slowing of oscillations also occurs in the visual system. Taken together, pathological synchronization of neuronal activity may turn out to be a promising pathophysiological concept for linking neuronal dysfunction to the diversity of clinical deficits in HE.},

Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

abstract = {In hepatic encephalopathy, a progressive and diffuse impairment in brain function is associated with gradual alterations that can be detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS). In some patients, a variety of movement disorders suggestive of extrapyramidal impairment points toward basal ganglia (BG) alterations. Accordingly, (i) hyperintensities at MRI predominant in the pallidum, an important region of BG involved in the motor control, (ii) redistribution of cerebral blood flow from cortical areas to BG structures observed using positron emission tomography studies, and (iii) the preferential pallidal location of Alzheimer astrocytosis, all support this hypothesis. In most clinical studies, little if any correlations have been found between cerebral hyperintensities and neurological manifestations. The application of a test designed to evaluate patients with Parkinson's disease (where extrapyramidal signs are typical) showed significant clinical correlations both with pallidal hyperintensity and with choline/creatine ratio at 1H MRS in BG structures. Because of complex neuronal connections between BG and many cortical areas, BG dysfunction may influence the neurocognitive manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy. Similarities between chronic Mn intoxication and cirrhosis suggest common pathophysiological mechanisms including altered dopaminergic neurotransmission, although information in chronic liver failure is limited. Clinical observations are presented regarding the evolution of parkinsonian signs in various situations.},

Acute HE in the thioacetamide (TAA) model caused a 54 {\%} decrease of mGSH content in the rat prefrontal cortex (pfc), but not in the striatum (str), nor did it affect the GSH content in the pfc or str homogenate. In the pfc, treatment with L- histidine (His), which is known to alleviate ONS-related symptoms in HE animals, attenuated the decrease of mGSH, and increased the GSH content in pfc and str homogenates and pfc microdialysates of control animals. His increased the expression of mRNA coding for the GSH synthesizing enzyme, glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) and decreased that of the GSH-degrading enzyme gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gammaGT). The results suggest that the decrease of mGSH may be an important contributing factor to mitochondrial dysfunction in HE, and delineate a new mechanistic aspect of the therapeutic potential of His in HE.},

abstract = {The prevalence of subclinical hepatic encephalopathy (SHE) varies according to the diagnostic tool used in its detection. Since a standardised approach to the diagnosis of SHE is not yet available, we compared psychometric tests and EEG spectral analysis. On the same day 32 cirrhotic patients without overt hepatic encephalopathy and 18 controls were assessed by psychometric tests, both standard and computerized (CPT), and by EEG spectral analysis (EEG-SA). The CPT, measuring reaction time (Rt) and errors (er), were Font, Choice1, Choice2 and Scan test. The standard psychometric tests were the number connection test (NCT), the Reitan-B test, the Line Tracing Test [for time: LTT(t) and for errors: LTT(er)], and the Symbol Digit test (SD). Both psychometric tests [Reitan-B test, LTT(er) and CPT but Font (Rt) and Choice2 (er)] and EEG-SA parameters [mean dominant frequency (MDF) and theta power (theta {\%})] significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with albumin plasma levels. LTT(er), Scan, Font, Choice1 and Choice2 were significantly related to theta {\%} and MDF. There was no control with positive EEG-SA, though one control was positive with LTT(t) and with the number of errors made during Font and Scan tests. The percentage of cirrhotics with positive EEG-SA was 34{\%} (CI95{\%} = 19-53), while 9-66{\%} were positive with psychometric tests, depending on the test considered. In spite of the correlation between neuropsychological and neurophysiological parameters, the diagnostic agreement between EEG-SA and each psychometric test was not high. IN CONCLUSION: 1) neurophysiological and neuropsychological impairment in cirrhotics without overt hepatic encephalopathy were found linked to each other and to hepatic dysfunction; 2) psychometric tests were not sufficiently good predictors of EEG alterations; therefore, neuropsychological tools can not substitute neurophysiological ones to detect CNS dysfunction in liver disease.},

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate cognition in the same animal model. Male adult Wistar rats underwent common bile duct ligation (BDL rats) or manipulation of common bile duct without ligation (control rats). Six weeks after surgery, control and BDL rats underwent object recognition behavioral task. The BDL rats developed chronic liver failure and exhibited a decreased discrimination index for short term memory (STM) when compared to the control group. There was no difference in long term memory (LTM) as well as in total time of exploration in the training, STM and LTM sessions between the BDL and control rats. Therefore, the BDL rats demonstrated impaired STM for recognition memory, which was not due to decreased exploration.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy can be a life-threatening complication of fulminant hepatic failure. By understanding the pathophysiology involved in the induction of this neuropsychiatric disorder, future therapeutic and/or preventive attempts could be considered. In this study, an attempt has been made in order to shed more light on the mechanisms involved in the effects of thioacetamide (TAA)-induced fulminant hepatic encephalopathy on: (a) the adult rat brain total antioxidant status (TAS) and (b) the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), (Na(+),K(+))-ATPase and Mg(2+)-ATPase. Moreover, in vitro experiments were conducted in order to evaluate the possible role of ammonia (incubated as NH(4)Cl, in a toxic concentration of 3mM) in the observed effects of TAA-induced fulminant hepatic encephalopathy on the examined adult rat brain enzyme activities. Fulminant hepatic encephalopathy caused a significant decrease in TAS (-22{\%}, p < 0.001) and the activity of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase (-26{\%}, p < 0.001), but had non-significant effects on the whole brain AChE and Mg(2+)-ATPase activities. The in vitro experiments (conducted through a 3h incubation with ammonia), showed no significant alterations in any of the examined parameters. Our in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that alterations in AChE and Mg(2+)-ATPase activities are not involved in the pathophysiology of the adult-onset fulminant hepatic encephalopathy, while the observed Na(+),K(+)-ATPase inhibition could be a result of the oxidative stress, neurotransmission deregulation, and/or of the presence of other toxic substances (that appear to act as direct or indirect inhibitors of the enzyme) and not due to the excess accumulation of ammonia in the brain.},

abstract = {There is no "gold standard" for diagnosing hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis. In consequence, the presence of this condition, unless floridly overt, is often missed. As a result, the majority of patients are denied the benefits of treatment. There are a number of individual techniques, which access different aspects of cerebral function that can be used, singly or in combination, to provide diagnostic information in this condition, including mental state assessment, psychometric testing, electroencephalography, sensory and cognitive evoked potentials, and neuroimaging. These have been variously applied to the study of hepatic encephalopathy but fundamental differences in the essential aims of the studies, as well as differences in the patient populations and the acquisition and analysis of the data, have made comparisons difficult. Thus, there is no clear consensus as to the sensitivity, specificity, or validity of these tests when used alone or in combination. There are, however, a number of additional methods that could be used to analyze the electrophysiological data, and a number of alternative evoked potentials that could be measured to provide better diagnostic information. In addition, there are a number of techniques, such as critical flicker frequency and smooth pursuit eye movements, which have not yet been applied systematically in this condition and which may provide useful diagnostic information. Clearly the methods for assessing hepatic encephalopathy need to be reviewed, newer methods for analyzing the electrophysiological data and newer techniques for assessing alternative aspects of cerebral function need to be explored for their diagnostic utility. This process should aim at developing a multidimensional diagnostic tool.},

abstract = {There is abundant evidence to suggest that alterations of excitatory and inhibitory amino acids play a significant role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in both acute and chronic liver diseases. Brain glutamate concentrations are reduced in patients who died in hepatic coma as well as in experimental HE, astrocytic reuptake of glutamate is compromised in liver failure and postsynaptic glutamate receptors (both NMDA and non-NMDA subclasses) are concomitantly reduced in density. Recent studies in experimental acute liver failure suggest reduced capacity of the astrocytic glutamate transporter in this condition. Together, this data suggests that neuron-astrocytic trafficking of glutamate is impared in HE. Other significant alterations of neuroactive amino acids in HE include a loss of taurine from brain cells to extracellular space, a phenomenon which could relate both to HE and to brain edema in acute liver failure. Increased concentrations of benzodiazepine-like compounds have been reported in human and experimental HE. Clinical trials with the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil reveal a beneficial effect in some patients with HE; the mechanism responsible for this effect, however, remains to be determined.},

abstract = {Induction of hyperammonaemia with nitrogen challenge in man can be used to study  the pathogenesis and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy complicating cirrhosis. Initially 20 g of glutamine was given orally as a flavored solution which resulted in doubling of blood ammonia concentration and this was associated with a deterioration in performance of the choice reaction time. The effect could have been due to a direct effect of glutamine rather than the ammonia generated so in subsequent experiments a glutamine free mixture of amino acids resembling the composition of haemoglobin was used (gastrointestinal bleeding is a known precipitant of hepatic encephalopathy). In Child grade B and C patients, 2-3 h after 54 g, slowing of the EEG was observed. The cerebral effects of induced hyperammonaemia were studied with diffusion weighted imaging and MR spectroscopy after giving 54 g of a mixture of threonine, serine and glycine when apparent diffusion coefficient increased. Also the change in ammonia levels correlated with the change in cerebral glutamine levels (r = 0.78, p = 0.002) suggesting intra cerebral formation of glutamine from ammonia and this may have accounted for the fall in cerebral myoinositol concentrations observed. Finally a colonic source for ammonia was confirmed by administering urea using colon coated capsules when ammonia concentrations slowly increased from 5 h after administration and rapidly after 10 h. In two patients the hyperammonaemia was ameliorated by pre treatment with Rifaximin 1200 mg per day for 1 week. Nitrogen challenge studies are thus a valuable model for studying new treatments for hepatic encephalopathy without the need to simultaneously treat precipitating factors.},

The aim was to evaluate factors that were associated with HE recurrence after lactulose withdrawal by analyzing the clinical phenotype, stool microbiome and systemic metabolome longitudinally. HE patients on a standard diet who were adherent on lactulose underwent characterization of their phenotype [cognition, inflammatory cytokines, in-vivo brain MR spectroscopy(MRS)], gut microbiome (stool Multitag Pyrosequencing) and metabolome (urine/serum ex-vivo MRS) analysis while on lactulose and on days 2, 14 and 30 post-withdrawal. Patients whose HE recurred post-withdrawal were compared to those without recurrence. We included seven men (53 +/- 8 years) who were adherent on lactulose after a precipitated HE episode were included. HE recurred in three men 32 +/- 6 days post-withdrawal. In-vivo brain MRS showed increased glutamine+glutamate (Glx) and decreased myoinositol with a reduction in stool Faecalibacterium spp., post-withdrawal. HE recurrence was predicted by poor baseline inhibitory control and block design performance and was associated with a shift of choline metabolism from tri-methylamine oxide formation towards the development of di-methylglycine, glycine and creatinine. This was accompanied by a mixed effect on the immune response (suppressed IL-10 and Th1/Th2/Th17 response). The correlation network showed Prevotella to be linked to improved cognition and decreased inflammation in patients without HE recurrence. We conclude that lactulose withdrawal results in worsening cognition, mixed inflammatory response effect, lowered stool Faecalibacterium and increase in MR-measurable brain Glx. HE recurrence post-lactulose withdrawal can be predicted by baseline cognitive performance and is accompanied by disrupted choline metabolism.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is clinically characterized by a large variety of symptoms including motor symptoms, cognitive deficits, as well as changes in the level of alertness up to hepatic coma. A number of pathological processes affecting glial and neuronal function have been identified, including hyper-ammonia, changes within the excitatory and inhibitory transmitter systems, as well as osmolytic changes with consecutive cell swelling. One explanation how these pathological processes result in neurological deficits in HE is the concept of pathologically synchronized oscillations within and between relevant brain regions. A number of studies suggest that the cognitive deficits and the reduced level of alertness in patients with HE can be attributed to a significantly slowed and pathologically synchronized spontaneous oscillatory brain activity, depending on the grade of HE. Moreover, HE motor symptoms, like postural tremor called"mini asterixis," have recently been shown to be associated with abnormal thalamo-cortical and cortico-muscular synchronization. Indirect evidence exists from studies of processing and recognition of flicker stimuli that in HE slowing of oscillations also occurs in the visual system. Taken together, pathological synchronization of neuronal activity may turn out to be a promising pathophysiological concept for linking neuronal dysfunction to the diversity of clinical deficits in HE.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neurological disease associated with hepatic dysfunction. Current knowledge suggests that hyperammonemia, related to liver failure, is a main factor contributing to the cerebral alterations in HE and that hyperammonemia might impair signal transduction associated with post-translational modification of proteins such as tyrosine-nitration and phosphorylation. However, the molecular bases of the HE remain unclear and very little is known about the occurrence of post-translational modification on in vivo proteins. In this exploratory study we look for evidence of post-translation modifications of proteins in the cerebellum of experimental HE rat models using a proteomic approach. For the first time we showed that hyperammonemia without liver failure (HA rats) and experimental HE with liver failure due to portacaval shunt (PCS rats) lead to a reduced protein nitration in rat cerebellum, where the undernitrated proteins were involved in energy metabolism and cytoskeleton remodelling. Moreover we showed that tyrosine nitration loss of these proteins was not necessarily associated to a change in their phosphorylation state as result of the disease. Interestingly the rat cerebellum phosphoproteome was mainly perturbed in PCS rats, whereas HA rats did not shown appreciable changes in their phosphoprotein profile. Since the protein nitration level decreased similarly in the cerebellum of both HA and PCS rats, this implies that the two disease models share common effects but also present some differential signalling effects in the cerebellum of the same animals. This study highlights the interest for studying the concerted action of multiple signalling pathways in HE development.},

abstract = {Infection and inflammation have been associated with the development of delirium  for many centuries and there is a rapidly growing evidence base supporting the role of inflammation in exacerbating the neurological manifestations of both acute and chronic liver failure. Inflammation in the context of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) can arise directly within the brain itself resulting in astrocytic, microglial and neuronal dysfunction, impacting on the development of 'brain failure'. Inflammation may also develop systemically and indirectly influence brain function. Systemic inflammation develops following liver injury, resulting in hyperammonemia and a 'cytotoxic soup' of pro-inflammatory mediators which are released into the circulation and modulate the impact of ammonia on the brain. The aim of this review is to summarise the current evidence base supporting the synergistic role of systemic inflammation and hyperammonemia in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. Systemic inflammation and ammonia induce neutrophil degranulation and release reactive oxygen species into the peripheral circulation that may ultimately cross the blood brain barrier. Circulating endotoxin arising from the gut (bacterial translocation), superimposed sepsis, and hyperammonemia upregulate the expression of microbial pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors. The early recognition and management of systemic inflammation may not only facilitate improved outcomes in HE but supports the development of novel therapeutic strategies that reduce circulating endotoxemia and immune cell dysfunction.},

abstract = {In patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) the blood concentration of ammonia is usually highly elevated. Ammonia readily enters brain cells from the blood, and toxic effects of ammonia on brain metabolism and neurotransmission are believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of HE. It has, however, been a matter of great controversy whether backflux of unmetabolized ammonia (NH(3) + NH(4) (+)) from brain cells to the blood occurs in man. In the present analysis of data from a dynamic PET study of brain (13)N-ammonia metabolism in healthy subjects and cirrhotic patients with and without HE, we provide the first unambiguous evidence for backflux of ammonia from brain cells to the blood in man. The high temporal and spatial resolution of modern PET technology was employed to distinguish between unidirectional blood-brain transport of ammonia and subsequent metabolism of the ammonia in the brain. In all 16 subjects, clearance of the unidirectional transport of (13)N-ammonia from the blood to brain cells (K(1)) was higher than the metabolic clearance of (13)N-ammonia from the blood (K(met)=K(1) k(3)/(k(2)+k(3)). This can only be explained by backflux (k(2)) of ammonia from brain cells to the blood. In conclusion, backflux of ammonia from the brain to the blood does indeed occur in both healthy subjects and cirrhotic patients with and without hepatic encephalopathy.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that alterations of GABAergic neurotransmission are implicated in the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Increased concentrations of endogenous benzodiazepines with positive allosteric modulatory properties at the GABA-A receptor complex were proposed as a pathophysiological mechanism to explain increased GABAergic tone in HE. However, results of controlled trials with benzodiazepine receptor antagonists have yielded equivocal results and increases in benzodiazepine levels in body fluids of cirrhotic patients were suggested to be largely accounted for by previous pharmaceutical benzodiazepine intake. In the present study the issue of benzodiazepine receptor ligands in brains of cirrhotic patients, and their contribution to alterations of GABA-A receptor complex in HE are addressed. "Benzodiazepine-like" ligands were present in trace amounts in autopsied brain tissue from control subjects (0.2 +/- 0.2 ng/g tissue), and from cirrhotic patients not previously exposed to benzodiazepine medication (0.8 +/- 0.4 ng/g tissue). In contrast, these ligands accumulate in brain extracts from cirrhotic patients previously exposed to benzodiazepines by up to 200-fold (161.5 +/- 93.2 DE ng/g tissue). Brain extracts from cirrhotic patients increased the binding of the GABA-A receptor agonist [3H]muscimol. This increase was minimal with brain extracts from controls (6.8 +/- 2.8{\%}), but was significant with brain extracts from cirrhotic patients without (29.4 +/- 2.7{\%}), or with (55.1 +/- 7.6{\%}) previous exposure to benzodiazepines. Addition of flumazenil, a selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist did not significantly modify the increase of [3H]muscimol binding by brain extracts from patients without prior exposure to benzodiazepines and only partially inhibited the increase of [3H]muscimol binding in presence of brain extracts from cirrhotic patients previously exposed to benzodiazepines. These findings suggest the presence of nonbenzodiazepine substances (possibly neurosteroids) with positive allosteric modulatory properties at the GABA-A receptor complex in brain in hepatic encephalopathy.},

abstract = {Benzodiazepines of natural origin (NBZDs) have been found in human blood and brains as well as in medicinal plants and foods. In plasma and brain tissue there are i.e. diazepam and nordiazepam equal to commercial drugs but there are also other benzodiazepine-like compounds termed "endozepines", which act as agonists at the benzodiazepine receptors of central type (CBR). A synthetic pathway for the production of NBZDs has not yet been found, but it has been suggested that micro-organisms may synthesize molecules with benzodiazepine-like structures. Hence NBZDs could be of both endogenous and exogenous source and be considered as natural anxyolitic and sedative. Interestingly there are also natural compounds, such as the polypeptide Diazepam Binding Inhibitor (DBI) acting as an "inversive agonist" implicated in fair and panic disorders. It has been suggested that NBZDs may play a role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Multidirectional studies evaluated NBZDs levels (1) in the blood of normal subjects, of cirrhotic with or without HE and in commercial benzodiazepine consumers; (2) in the blood of cirrhotic treated or not with a non-absorbable antibiotic; (3) in several constituents of our diet. In conclusion, NBZDs increase sometime in cirrhotics with or without HE but they reach concentrations not higher than those found in commercial benzodiazepines consumers. Hence NBZDs must be considered as occasional precipitating factor of HE and benzodiazepine antagonists only symptomatic drugs. The finding that NBZDs may be in part synthesized by intestinal bacterial flora and in part constituent of our diet underlines the importance to feed cirrhotic patients with selected food.},

abstract = {Benzodiazepine receptor ligands are suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis  of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Accumulation of these ligands in brain was suggested to explain in part the notion of"increased GABAergic tone," the rational for which arose initially from reports of a beneficial effect of the selective benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil in HE patients. It was suggested on the basis of the effect of flumazenil in human HE that liver failure may result in alterations of the density and/or affinity of the benzodiazepine-associated GABA-A receptor site. Subsequent controlled-clinical trials showed that fumazenil had a transient beneficial effect in only a subpopulation of HE patients. In contrast to the antagonists, partial inverse agonists of the benzodiazepine receptor have unequivocal beneficial effects on behavioral and electro-physiological performance in all experimental models of HE studied so far. Benzodiazepine-associated GABA-A receptors have consistently been demonstrated to be unaltered in both human and experimental HE. Contrary to initial reports, the so-called "endogenous benzodiazepines" do not appear to be significantly related to the pathogenesis of HE. On the other hand, nonbenzodiazepine GABA-A receptor complex modulators, such as neuro-steroids, recently identified in brain in human and experimental HE, may provide a new mechanistic basis for this disorder and lead to novel treatments for human HE.},

We analyzed the presence of mild cognitive impairment (CI) by using the PHES battery of psychometric tests and measured the levels of ammonia and of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-18 in blood of patients with different types of liver or dermatological diseases resulting in different grades of hyperammonemia and/or inflammation. The study included patients with 1) liver cirrhosis, showing hyperammonemia and inflammation; 2) non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) showing inflammation but not hyperammonemia; 3) non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) showing inflammation and very mild hyperammonemia; 4) psoriasis, showing inflammation but not hyperammonemia; 5) keloids, showing both inflammation and hyperammonemia and 6) controls without inflammation or hyperammonemia. The data reported show that in patients with liver diseases, cognitive impairment may appear before progression to cirrhosis if hyperammonemia and inflammation are high enough. Five out of 11 patients with NASH, without liver cirrhosis, showed cognitive impairment associated with hyperammonemia and inflammation. Patients with keloids showed cognitive impairment associated with hyperammonemia and inflammation, in the absence of liver disease. Hyperammonemia or inflammation alone did not induce CI but the combination of certain levels of hyperammonemia and inflammation is enough to induce CI, even without liver disease.},

abstract = {Although ammonia is considered the main factor involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), it correlates well with the severity of HE in acute liver failure, but not in chronic liver disease. Oxidative stress is another factor believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of this syndrome; it represents an imbalance between the production and neutralization of reactive oxygen species, which leads to cellular dysfunction. In the setting of liver disease, oxidative stress represents a systemic phenomenon induced by several mechanisms: decreased antioxidant synthesis, increased systemic release of oxidant enzymes, generation of reactive oxygen species, and impaired neutrophil function. High ammonia concentrations induce cerebral oxidative stress, thus contributing to severe hepatic encephalopathy, as observed in acute liver failure. In chronic liver disease, significantly lower degrees of hyperammonemia (<500 muM) do not induce cerebral nor systemic oxidative stress. Data from both animal and human studies sustain that there is a synergistic effect between systemic oxidative stress, and ammonia that is implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy can be a life-threatening complication of fulminant hepatic failure. By understanding the pathophysiology involved in the induction of this neuropsychiatric disorder, future therapeutic and/or preventive attempts could be considered. In this study, an attempt has been made in order to shed more light on the mechanisms involved in the effects of thioacetamide (TAA)-induced fulminant hepatic encephalopathy on: (a) the adult rat brain total antioxidant status (TAS) and (b) the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), (Na(+),K(+))-ATPase and Mg(2+)-ATPase. Moreover, in vitro experiments were conducted in order to evaluate the possible role of ammonia (incubated as NH(4)Cl, in a toxic concentration of 3mM) in the observed effects of TAA-induced fulminant hepatic encephalopathy on the examined adult rat brain enzyme activities. Fulminant hepatic encephalopathy caused a significant decrease in TAS (-22{\%}, p < 0.001) and the activity of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase (-26{\%}, p < 0.001), but had non-significant effects on the whole brain AChE and Mg(2+)-ATPase activities. The in vitro experiments (conducted through a 3h incubation with ammonia), showed no significant alterations in any of the examined parameters. Our in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that alterations in AChE and Mg(2+)-ATPase activities are not involved in the pathophysiology of the adult-onset fulminant hepatic encephalopathy, while the observed Na(+),K(+)-ATPase inhibition could be a result of the oxidative stress, neurotransmission deregulation, and/or of the presence of other toxic substances (that appear to act as direct or indirect inhibitors of the enzyme) and not due to the excess accumulation of ammonia in the brain.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neurological disease associated with hepatic dysfunction. Current knowledge suggests that hyperammonemia, related to liver failure, is a main factor contributing to the cerebral alterations in HE and that hyperammonemia might impair signal transduction associated with post-translational modification of proteins such as tyrosine-nitration and phosphorylation. However, the molecular bases of the HE remain unclear and very little is known about the occurrence of post-translational modification on in vivo proteins. In this exploratory study we look for evidence of post-translation modifications of proteins in the cerebellum of experimental HE rat models using a proteomic approach. For the first time we showed that hyperammonemia without liver failure (HA rats) and experimental HE with liver failure due to portacaval shunt (PCS rats) lead to a reduced protein nitration in rat cerebellum, where the undernitrated proteins were involved in energy metabolism and cytoskeleton remodelling. Moreover we showed that tyrosine nitration loss of these proteins was not necessarily associated to a change in their phosphorylation state as result of the disease. Interestingly the rat cerebellum phosphoproteome was mainly perturbed in PCS rats, whereas HA rats did not shown appreciable changes in their phosphoprotein profile. Since the protein nitration level decreased similarly in the cerebellum of both HA and PCS rats, this implies that the two disease models share common effects but also present some differential signalling effects in the cerebellum of the same animals. This study highlights the interest for studying the concerted action of multiple signalling pathways in HE development.},

By contrast, both in vivo conditions primarily affected the synaptic mitochondrial enzymes: TAA-induced HE produced a 26{\%} decrease of synaptic mitochondrial AAT and a 50{\%} decrease of synaptic mitochondrial MDH. Hyperammonemia inhibited synaptic mitochondrial AAT by 30{\%} and synaptic mitochondrial MDH by 45{\%}. HE produced no effect at all in nonsynaptic mitochondria while hyperammonemia produced a 30{\%} increase in the AAT activity, but no changes in MDH. All the experimental conditions affected the nonsynaptic mitochondria PC: ammonium chloride in vitro produced a 20{\%} decrease, TAA-induced HE--a 30{\%} decrease, whereas hyperammonemia inhibited the enzyme by 53{\%}. The PC activity in synaptic mitochondria was very low (about 2{\%} of that measured in nonsynaptic mitochondria), which is consistent with the primarily astrocytic localization of the enzyme.},

abstract = {According to one popular theory, hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is partly caused by  an imbalance in plasma amino acid levels. The Fischer's ratio between branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) and aromatic amino acids (AAAs) correlates with the degree of HE; the lower Fischer's ratio, the higher the grade of HE. Extra-corporeal liver support systems, like MARS(R)-albumin dialysis (Molecular Adsorbents Recirculating System), can improve HE. The MARS(R) system uses a hyperosmolar albumin circuit to remove both water-soluble and albumin-bound substances. Plasma levels of neuroactive amino acids were analyzed in 82 consecutive patients with life-threatening liver failure admitted to our ICU. All patients fulfilled our indications for MARS treatment and most also fulfilled the criteria for liver transplantation (LTx). In patients with acute liver failure (ALF), as compared to those with acute decompensation of chronic liver failure (AcOChr), levels of leucine and isoleucine were significantly higher before MARS(R) treatment. In all patients, before MARS(R) treatment the higher the grade of HE grade the lower was the Fischer's ratio and higher were the levels of inhibitory neuroactive amino acids. During MARS(R) treatments the Fischer's ratio increased, and the grade of HE decreased. The increase in Fischer's ratio was mainly due to the decrease in AAAs. The plasma levels of neuroactive amino acids, methionine, glutamine, glutamate, histidine and taurine decreased during MARS(R)-treatment. In this study MARS(R)-albumin dialysis had a favorable effect on the plasma amino acid profile of patients with HE.},

Rats underwent bile duct ligation (BDL) and 2 weeks later they were treated with i.p. injection of guanosine 7.5 mg/kg once a day for 1-week. We evaluated the effects of guanosine in HE studying several aspects: a) animal behavior using open field and Y-maze tasks; b) brain rhythm changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings; c) purines and glutamate levels in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF); and d) oxidative stress parameters in the brain. BDL rats presented increased levels of glutamate, purines and metabolites in the CSF, as well as increased oxidative damage. Guanosine was able not only to prevent these effects but also to attenuate the behavioral and EEG impairment induced by BDL. Our study shows the neuroprotective effects of systemic administration of guanosine in a rat model of HE and highlights the involvement of purinergic system in the physiopathology of this disease.},

abstract = {Positron-emission tomography (PET) is a quantitative technique that produces images of biological or physiological processes. The nature of the image depends on the tracer used: common tracers used to study HE include 18F-fluordeoxyglucose, a marker of glucose metabolism; 15O-water, a marker of cerebral blood flow; and 13N-ammonia, a marker of ammonia metabolism. Combined blood flow and ammonia metabolism studies can be used to calculate the permeability surface area product for ammonia at the blood brain barrier. To take full advantage of PET, the data should be analyzed using one of the several sophisticated image processing and analysis techniques that are available. Thus, PET is an ideal technique to evaluate ammonia metabolism and, because of a close linkage of blood flow and glucose metabolism with neural activity, to investigate the neural response to drugs and other treatments and to examine neural systems that mediate specific tasks that are impaired in patients with HE.},

Minimal HE, the earliest manifestation of HE, has drawn increasing attention in the last decade. Minimal HE is associated with a series of brain functional changes, such as attention, working memory, and so on. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI), especially resting-state fMRI has been used to explore the brain functional changes of HE, yielding important insights for understanding pathophysiological mechanisms and functional reorganization of HE. This paper briefly reviews the principles of BOLD fMRI, potential applications of resting-state fMRI with advanced post-processing algorithms such as regional homogeneity, amplitude of low frequency fluctuation, functional connectivity and future research perspective in this field.},

abstract = {Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) is a serious neuropsychiatric condition of both acute and chronic liver failure. Acute liver failure is characterized by rapid evolution of HE and by brain edema. Portal-Systemic encephalopathy (PSE) is particularly prevalent following treatment of portal hypertension or ascites by the TIPS procedure. Available evidence currently suggests that neurotransmission changes rather than brain energy failure are the primary cause of HE. Recent studies both in autopsied brain tissue from HE patients as well as in experimental animal models of HE reveal that liver failure results in altered expression of several genes coding for proteins having key roles in the control of neuronal excitability. Such alterations include decreased expression of the glutamate transporter GLT-1, and increased expression of monoamine oxidase (MAO-A isoform), the "peripheral-type" benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR) as well as constitutive neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Such changes result in altered protein expression and in increased extracellular brain glutamate, increased degradation of monoamine neurotransmitters, increased synthesis of neurosteroids with inhibitory properties, and increased production of nitric oxide (respectively) in brain in chronic liver failure. In the case of GLT-1, PTBR, and nNOS, alterations in expression result from exposure to ammonia and/or manganese, two neurotoxic agents shown previously to be increased in brain in liver failure.},

abstract = {Neurocognitive dysfunction of varying degrees is common in patients with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis (HBV-RC) without overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE). However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these dysfunctions are not well understood. We sought to identify changes in the neural activity of patients with HBV-RC without OHE in the resting state by using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) method and to determine whether these changes were related to impaired cognition. Resting-state functional MRI data from 30 patients with HBV-RC and 30 healthy controls matched for age, sex, and years of education were compared to determine any differences in the ALFF between the two groups. Cognition was measured with the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES), and the relationship between these scores and ALFF variation was assessed. Compared with controls, patients showed widespread lower standardized ALFF (mALFF) values in visual association areas (bilateral lingual gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, and left inferior temporal gyrus), motor-related areas (bilateral precentral gyrus, paracentral lobule, and right postcentral gyrus), and the default mode network (bilateral cuneus/precuneus and inferior parietal lobule). Higher mALFF values were found in the bilateral orbital gyrus/rectal gyrus. In patients, mALFF values were significantly positive correlated with the PHES in the right middle occipital gyrus and bilateral precentral gyrus. Our findings of resting-state abnormalities in patients with HBV-RC without OHE suggest that neurocognitive dysfunction in patients with HBV-RC without OHE may be caused by abnormal neural activity in multiple brain regions.},

abstract = {There is substantial clinical and experimental evidence that ammonia is a major factor in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. In the article is demonstrated that in hepatocellular dysfunction, ammonia detoxification to glutamine (GLN) in skeletal muscle, brain, and likely the lungs, is activated. In addition to ammonia detoxification, enhanced GLN production may exert beneficial effects on the immune system and gut barrier function. However, enhanced GLN synthesis may exert adverse effects in the brain (swelling of astrocytes or altered neurotransmission) and stimulate catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA; valine, leucine, and isoleucine) in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the majority of GLN produced is released to the blood and catabolized in enterocytes and the kidneys to ammonia, which due to liver injury escapes detoxification to urea and appears in peripheral blood. As only one molecule of ammonia is detoxified in GLN synthesis whereas two molecules may appear in GLN breakdown, these events can be seen as a vicious cycle in which enhanced ammonia concentration activates synthesis of GLN leading to its subsequent catabolism and increase in ammonia levels in the blood. These alterations may explain why therapies targeted to intestinal bacteria have only a limited effect on ammonia levels in patients with liver failure and indicate the needs of new therapeutic strategies focused on GLN metabolism. It is demonstrated that each of the various treatment options targeting only one the of the ammonia-lowering mechanisms that affect GLN metabolism, such as enhancing GLN synthesis (BCAA), suppressing ammonia production from GLN breakdown (glutaminase inhibitors and alpha-ketoglutarate), and promoting GLN elimination (phenylbutyrate) exerts substantial adverse effects that can be avoided if their combination is tailored to the specific needs of each patient.},

A review of the literature on this subject is reported. The visually interpreted EEG is only of benefit in the late stages of hepatic encephalopathy. EEG spectral analysis allows identification of all stages of the condition. Brainstem auditory evoked responses are normal in encephalopathy. Visual evoked responses show an increase in the latency and eventual loss of individual component waves as encephalopathy progresses. Somatosensory evoked responses show a progressive prolongation of peak and inter-peak latency which correlates with the severity of encephalopathy. The auditory P300 evoked response shows an increased latency with the development of hepatic encephalopathy. Event related potentials provide objective diagnostic markers of the development of hepatic encephalopathy. The increased use of this technology in the assessment of patients with this condition should be of clinical benefit in its management.},

abstract = {1H magnetic resonance (1H MR) studies of the brain in patients with liver diseases have shown several abnormalities that may be relevant for the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. 1H magnetic resonance imaging shows a typical pallidal hyperintensity on T1-weighted images. This abnormality appears to be secondary to the accumulation of manganese in basal ganglia because of portal-systemic shunting. No direct correlation between the magnitude of pallidal hyperintensity and the grade of hepatic encephalopathy has been found, but some studies have related pallidal hyperintensity to parkinsonism. 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows relative to creatine an increase in glutamine/glutamate (Glx) signal and a decrease of choline containing compounds (Cho) and myo-inositol. Abnormalities in the Glx signal have been interpreted as an increase in brain glutamine secondary to the metabolism of ammonia in astrocytes. Disturbances of Cho and myo-inositol have been interpreted as a compensatory response to the increase in intracellular osmolality caused by the accumulation of glutamine in astrocytes. In addition, magnetization transfer imaging shows signs compatible with low-grade cerebral edema. Altogether, 1H MR studies suggest the accumulation of manganese and the development of osmotic abnormalities in the brain of patients with cirrhosis. These abnormalities appear to participate in some of the neurological manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy.},

abstract = {Memory dysfunction is reported in cirrhotics. The aim of this paper was to increase insight into memory function of cirrhotic patients without overt hepatic encephalopathy. Eighty-six consecutive cirrhotics without overt hepatic encephalopathy (aged 54+/-10 yr., mean+/-s.d.) and 28 controls (52+/-10 yr.) with comparable education level were enrolled. Seventeen patients were class A, 55 class B, 14 class C according to Child-Pugh classification; 29 had alcoholic cirrhosis. The presence of subclinical signs of central nervous system dysfunction were assessed by Number Connection Test (NCT) and quantified EEG analysis. Memory scanning was evaluated by reaction times (RTs) in the Sternberg paradigm. MANOVA analysis showed that RTs were higher (F1,99=11, p<0.01) and time outs (TOs) more frequent (F1,110=10, p<0.01) in cirrhotics than in controls, whereas button press errors (BPEs) did not differ significantly (F1,110=2, p=n.s.). In cirrhotics, an interaction Child-Pugh class x memory set size was found (F2,146=4, p<0.05), showing exceedingly delayed RTs with greater memory set size in class C patients. Patients with altered NCT had significantly prolonged RTs (F1,71=4, p<0.05) and more TOs (F1,82=11, p<0.01) than patients with normal NCT. Cirrhotics with altered EEG had significantly prolonged RTs (F2,70=6, p<0.01). RTs were found to be correlated to alpha relative power (r=-0.4, p<0.01) and theta relative power (r=0.4, p<0.01). In conclusion, cirrhotics without over encephalopathy, but with NCT or EEG alterations, perform a computerized digit recognition task more slowly and with higher TOs than cirrhotic patients with normal NCT or EEG. In severe liver insufficiency (class C cirrhotics) also an impairment of memory scanning was detected. Sternberg test performance correlates with NCT and quantitative EEG parameters.},

The latter scores are considered to represent the individual discrepancies between professional demands and cerebral performance. Since minimal HE affects psychomotor function but not verbal abilities this discrepancy exists predominantly in "blue collar workers." In accordance with this 60{\%} of "blue collar" (in contrast to 20{\%} of "white collar") workers of our patient group were considered unfit for work.

Three-hundred consecutive hospitalized cirrhotic patients were prospectively enrolled. Liver function, a complete neurocognitive assessment for the diagnosis of clinical or subclinical hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and parameters of nutritional status and muscle function were evaluated in each patient at admission. Clinically overt HE, at admission or in the last 12 months, or a diagnosis of minimal HE were significantly higher in cirrhotic patients with muscle depletion or decreased muscle strength. The fasting venous blood ammonia concentrations were also higher in this group. Muscle depletion was an independent risk factor at multivariate analysis both for overt and minimal HE.

abstract = {Neuroinflammation plays a main role in neurological deficits in rats with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) due to portacaval shunt (PCS). Treating PCS rats with SB239063, an inhibitor of MAP-kinase-p38, reduces microglial activation and brain inflammatory markers and restores cognitive and motor function. The translocator protein-(18-kDa) (TSPO) is considered a biomarker of neuroinflammation. TSPO is increased in brain of PCS rats and of cirrhotic patients that died in hepatic coma. Rats with MHE show strong microglial activation in cerebellum and milder in other areas when assessed by MHC-II immunohistochemistry. This work aims were assessing: 1) whether binding of TSPO ligands is selectively increased in cerebellum in PCS rats; 2) whether treatment with SB239063 reduces binding of TSPO ligands in PCS rats; 3) which cell type (microglia, astrocytes) increases TSPO expression. Quantitative autoradiography was used to assess TSPO-selective 3H-(R)-PK11195 binding to different brain areas. TSPO expression increased differentially in PCS rats, reaching mild expression in striatum or thalamus and very high levels in cerebellum. TSPO was expressed in astrocytes and microglia. Treatment with SB239063 did not reduces 3[H]-PK11195 binding in PCS rats. SB239063 reduces microglial activation and levels of inflammatory markers, but not binding of TSPO ligands. This indicates that SB239063-induced neuroinflammation reduction in PCS rats is not mediated by effects on TSPO. Also, enhanced TSPO expression is not always associated with cognitive or motor deficits. If enhanced TSPO expression plays a role in mechanisms leading to neurological alterations in MHE, SB239063 would interfere these mechanisms at a later step.},

Compared to HC subjects, blood flow and energy metabolism had declined in all gray matter regions of the brain in patients with HE but not significantly in patients with CL. Analysis of flow-metabolism coupling indicated that blood flow declined in HE as a consequence of reduced brain energy metabolism implied by the calculation of increased mitochondrial oxygen tensions that patients with HE were unable to utilize.

Accordingly, (i) hyperintensities at MRI predominant in the pallidum, an important region of BG involved in the motor control, (ii) redistribution of cerebral blood flow from cortical areas to BG structures observed using positron emission tomography studies, and (iii) the preferential pallidal location of Alzheimer astrocytosis, all support this hypothesis. In most clinical studies, little if any correlations have been found between cerebral hyperintensities and neurological manifestations. The application of a test designed to evaluate patients with Parkinson's disease (where extrapyramidal signs are typical) showed significant clinical correlations both with pallidal hyperintensity and with choline/creatine ratio at 1H MRS in BG structures. Because of complex neuronal connections between BG and many cortical areas, BG dysfunction may influence the neurocognitive manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy. Similarities between chronic Mn intoxication and cirrhosis suggest common pathophysiological mechanisms including altered dopaminergic neurotransmission, although information in chronic liver failure is limited. Clinical observations are presented regarding the evolution of parkinsonian signs in various situations.},

At present the most frequently used psychometric methods for diagnosing minimal hepatic encephalopathy are the Inhibitory Control Test and the Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score PHES. Another frequently used method is Critical Flicker Frequency. The PHES and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status have been recommended for diagnosing mHE by a working party commissioned by the International Society for Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism. Recently the Continuous Reaction Time Test, which has been used in the 1980ies, has gained new interest. Today, no data are available that allow to decide which of these methods is the most appropriate. In fact, even basic information such as dependence on age, sex and education or influence of diseases that frequently accompany liver cirrhosis upon test results is missing for most of them. Future studies must address these questions to improve diagnosis of mHE.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with increased ammonia levels in plasma and brain. Different treatment strategies have been developed to ameliorate the detrimental effects of the ammonia load. One such strategy is based on the finding of a low level of the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) in plasma of patients suffering from HE and the assumption that in particular isoleucine could be beneficial to brain energy metabolism as it is metabolized to the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate and precursor succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, respectively. This would enable de novo synthesis of glutamine via alpha-ketoglutarate and glutamate and at the same time stimulate oxidative metabolism. The present mini-review summarizes the metabolic basis for this hypothesis delineating studies in the brain in vivo as well as in cultured neural cells aimed at elucidating the metabolism of the BCAAs focusing on isoleucine. The conclusion is that isoleucine appears at least partially to act in this fashion albeit its metabolism is quantitatively relatively modest. In addition, a short section on the role of the BCAAs in synaptic ammonia homeostasis is included along with some thoughts on the role of the BCAAs in other pathologies such as cancer.},

abstract = {There is substantial clinical and experimental evidence that ammonia is a major factor in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. In the article is demonstrated that in hepatocellular dysfunction, ammonia detoxification to glutamine (GLN) in skeletal muscle, brain, and likely the lungs, is activated. In addition to ammonia detoxification, enhanced GLN production may exert beneficial effects on the immune system and gut barrier function. However, enhanced GLN synthesis may exert adverse effects in the brain (swelling of astrocytes or altered neurotransmission) and stimulate catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA; valine, leucine, and isoleucine) in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the majority of GLN produced is released to the blood and catabolized in enterocytes and the kidneys to ammonia, which due to liver injury escapes detoxification to urea and appears in peripheral blood. As only one molecule of ammonia is detoxified in GLN synthesis whereas two molecules may appear in GLN breakdown, these events can be seen as a vicious cycle in which enhanced ammonia concentration activates synthesis of GLN leading to its subsequent catabolism and increase in ammonia levels in the blood. These alterations may explain why therapies targeted to intestinal bacteria have only a limited effect on ammonia levels in patients with liver failure and indicate the needs of new therapeutic strategies focused on GLN metabolism. It is demonstrated that each of the various treatment options targeting only one the of the ammonia-lowering mechanisms that affect GLN metabolism, such as enhancing GLN synthesis (BCAA), suppressing ammonia production from GLN breakdown (glutaminase inhibitors and alpha-ketoglutarate), and promoting GLN elimination (phenylbutyrate) exerts substantial adverse effects that can be avoided if their combination is tailored to the specific needs of each patient.},

GAD activities varied as a function of agonal status in control samples, confirming a previous report, but were unchanged in brain tissue from cirrhotic patients, suggesting no loss of integrity of presynaptic GABA nerve terminals in this disease. On the other hand, GS activities were selectively decreased by 25{\%} (P less than 0.01) in caudate nuclei of cirrhotic patients, reflecting, no doubt, the severe astrocytosis consistently observed in this brain structure. CAT activities, expressed per milligram of protein, were found to be increased by 30{\%} (P less than 0.01) in the prefrontal cortex of cirrhotic patients. Whether such changes result from a relative increase in CAT as a consequence of losses of astrocytic protein or reflect altered cholinergic function in hepatic encephalopathy associated with chronic liver disease awaits further study.},

These data were generated using detergent-Triton X-100-treated neural membranes. While performing further studies it was noted that the increase in BZ receptor density was not demonstrable when Triton X-100 preparation was not employed. Accordingly the binding of [3H] flunitrazepam, a BZ ligand, to neural membranes from cortices of normal rabbits and rabbits with HE due to (GalN)-induced FHF was studied with and without detergent preparation. Scatchard plot analysis of the binding data indicated that when no detergent was employed, the apparent affinity and density of BZ receptors were similar for control membranes and membranes from animals in HE. BZ receptors from animals in HE were shown to be more resistant to solubilization by Triton than control membranes. These findings (a) afford a potential explanation for the apparent increase in density of BZ receptors in this model when Triton treatment of neural membranes is utilized and (b) suggest that recent evidence for increased GABAergic tone in the syndrome of HE is not dependent on an increased density of BZ receptors.},

abstract = {Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory amino acid in the central nervous system (CNS). Experiments with animal models of HE, and with brain slices or cultured CNS cells treated with ammonia, have documented changes in GABA distribution and transport, and modulation of the responses of both the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex and GABA(B) receptors. Although many of the data point to an enhancement of GABAergic transmission probably contributing to HE, the evidence is not unequivocal. The major weaknesses of the GABA theory are (1) in a vast majority of HE models, there were no alterations of GABA content in the brain tissue and/or extracellular space, indicating that exposure of neurons to GABA may not have been altered, (2) changes in the affinity and capacity of GABA receptor binding were either absent or qualitatively different in HE models of comparable severity and duration, and (3) no sound changes in the GABAergic system parameters were noted in clinical cases of HE. Taurine (Tau) is an amino acid that is thought to mimic GABA function because of its agonistic properties towards GABA(A) receptors, and to contribute to neuroprotection and osmoregulation. These effects require Tau redistribution between the different cell compartments and the extracellular space. Acute treatment with ammonia evokes massive release of radiolabeled or endogenous Tau from CNS tissues in vivo and in vitro, and the underlying mechanism of Tau release differs from the release evoked by depolarizing conditions or hypoosmotic treatment. Subacute or chronic HE, and also long-term treatment of cultured CNS cells in vitro with ammonia, increase spontaneous Tau "leakage" from the tissue. This is accompanied by a decreased potassium- or hypoosmolarity-induced release of Tau and often by cell swelling, indicating impaired osmoregulation. In in vivo models of HE, Tau leakage is manifested by its increased accumulation in the extrasynaptic space, which may promote inhibitory neurotransmission and/or cell membrane protection. In chronic HE in humans, decreased Tau content in CNS is thought to be one of the causes of cerebral edema. However, understanding of the impact of the changes in Tau content and transport on the pathogenic mechanisms of HE is hampered by the lack of clear-cut evidence regarding the various roles of Tau in the normal CNS.},

abstract = {It is generally assumed that neuronal cell death is minimal in liver failure and  is insufficient to account for the neuropsychiatric symptoms characteristic of hepatic encephalopathy. However, contrary to this assumption, neuronal cell damage and death are well documented in liver failure patients, taking the form of several distinct clinical entities namely acquired (non-Wilsonian) hepatocerebral degeneration, cirrhosis-related Parkinsonism, post-shunt myelopathy and cerebellar degeneration. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that liver failure contributes to the severity of neuronal loss in Wernicke's encephalopathy. The long-standing nature of the thalamic and cerebellar lesions, over 80{\%} of which are missed by routine clinical evaluation, together with the probability that they are nutritional in origin, underscores the need for careful nutritional management (adequate dietary protein, Vitamin B(1)) in liver failure patients. Mechanisms identified with the potential to cause neuronal cell death in liver failure include NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity, lactic acidosis, oxidative/nitrosative stress and the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The extent of neuronal damage in liver failure may be attenuated by compensatory mechanisms that include down-regulation of NMDA receptors, hypothermia and the presence of neuroprotective steroids such as allopregnanolone. These findings suggest that some of the purported "sequelae" of liver transplantation (gait ataxia, memory loss, confusion) could reflect preexisting neuropathology.},

abstract = {The NMDA type of glutamate receptors modulates learning and memory. Excessive activation of NMDA receptors leads to neuronal degeneration and death. Hyperammonemia and liver failure alter the function of NMDA receptors and of some associated signal transduction pathways. The alterations are different in acute and chronic hyperammonemia and liver failure. Acute intoxication with large doses of ammonia (and probably acute liver failure) leads to excessive NMDA receptors activation, which is responsible for ammonia-induced death. In contrast, chronic hyperammonemia induces adaptive responses resulting in impairment of signal transduction associated to NMDA receptors. The function of the glutamate-nitric oxide-cGMP pathway is impaired in brain in vivo in animal models of chronic liver failure or hyperammonemia and in homogenates from brains of patients died in hepatic encephalopathy. The impairment of this pathway leads to reduced cGMP and contributes to impaired cognitive function in hepatic encephalopathy. Learning ability is reduced in animal models of chronic liver failure and hyperammonemia and is restored by pharmacological manipulation of brain cGMP by administering phosphodiesterase inhibitors (zaprinast or sildenafil) or cGMP itself. NMDA receptors are therefore involved both in death induced by acute ammonia toxicity (and likely by acute liver failure) and in cognitive impairment in hepatic encephalopathy.},

@article{Romero-Gomez2005,
abstract = {Disturbed body nitrogen homeostasis due to impaired hepatic urea synthesis leads  to an alteration in inter-organ ammonia trafficking, resulting in hyperammonemia. Glutamine (Gln) synthase is the alternative pathway for ammonia detoxification. Gln taken up by several organs is split by the intramitochondrial phosphate-activated enzyme glutaminase (PAG) into glutamate (Glu) and ammonia. In cirrhotic patients with portosystemic intrahepatic shunt, the main source of systemic hyperammonemia is the small intestine, and ammonia derives mainly from Gln deamidation. Recently, PAG has been found increased in cirrhotics showing minimal hepatic encephalopathy and, therefore, could be implicated in the production of systemic hyperammonemia in these patients. Intestinal PAG activity correlates with psychometric test and magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings. Moreover, nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor seem to be the major factors regulating intestinal ammonia production in cirrhotics. In the brain, PAG localized into the astrocytes is responsible for ammonia and free-radical production. The blockade of PAG, using 6-oxo-5-norleucine, avoids the toxic effects of Gln accumulation in the brain. These data support an important role for intestinal and brain glutaminase in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and could be a new target for future therapies.},

@article{McPhail2010,
abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a diverse manifestation of acute and chronic liver failure, ranging from cognitive impairment, only detectable on psychometric evaluation through to confusion, coma and death from cerebral oedema. While there is widespread acceptance of its importance, there is little consensus on how best to diagnose and monitor HE. Clinical descriptions, psychometric testing, electroencephalography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (and lately, MR spectroscopy) have all been proposed. MR techniques, in contrast to other modalities, have the benefit of objectivity and of being able to interrogate the brain directly with respect to changes in brain size, function and the metabolic disturbances thought to underlie HE, particularly in the context of astrocyte swelling. Modern clinical MRI scanners with multinuclear MR spectroscopy capabilities and brain mapping software can demonstrate structural and functional cellular changes using volumetric MRI, magnetization transfer MRI, diffusion-weighting MRI, functional MRI with oxygenation measurements and in vivo and in vitro (1)H and (31)P MR spectroscopy. This review describes the relative merits of these techniques and provides guidance on the directions for future research and translation into clinical practice.},

@book{Iacus2008,
abstract = {This book is very different from any other publication in the field and it is unique because of its focus on the practical implementation of the simulation and estimation methods presented. The book should be useful to practitioners and students with minimal mathematical background, but because of the many R programs, probably also to many mathematically well educated practitioners. Many of the methods presented in the book have, so far, not been used much in practice because the lack of an implementation in a unified framework. This book fills the gap. With the R code included in this book, a lot of useful methods become easy to use for practitioners and students. An R package called `sde' provides functionswith easy interfaces ready to be used on empirical data from real life applications. Although it contains a wide range of results, the book has an introductory character and necessarily does not cover the whole spectrum of simulation and inference for general stochastic differential equations. The book is organized in four chapters. The first one introduces the subject and presents several classes of processes used in many fields of mathematics, computational biology, finance and the social sciences. The second chapter is devoted to simulation schemes and covers new methods not available in other milestones publication known so far. The third one is focused on parametric estimation techniques. In particular, it includes exact likelihood inference, approximated and pseudo-likelihood methods, estimating functions, generalized method of moments and other techniques. The last chapter contains miscellaneous topics like nonparametric estimation, model identification and change point estimation. The reader non-expert in R language, will find a concise introduction to this environment focused on the subject of the book which should allow for instant use of the proposed material. To each R functions presented in the book a documentation page is available at the end of the book.},

abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful and versatile tool for the investigation of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). This nuclear medicine imaging technique produces quantitative images of the distribution of a radiopharmaceutical at one or more times after its administration. Thus, PET images can be used as data in mathematical models of physiologically important processes, including cerebral blood flow, an index of neural activity, or glucose and ammonia metabolism. Using PET, we have demonstrated abnormalities in all of these processes in patients, even though many had only minimal HE. In HE patients we have found increases in the cerebral ammonia metabolic rate, because of hyperammonemia and an increase in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to ammonia and abnormal patterns of blood flow and glucose metabolism. In a recent collaborative study, alterations in the resting glucose metabolic rate were found to have significant correlations with a variety of neuropsychological tests used to detect mild HE including Trailmaking A and B, symbol-digit, and other tests. Activation techniques have not yet been applied to map sites affected by HE, but recent data using the paced serial auditory addition test and an auditory continuous performance task have proven to be sensitive indicators in minimally impaired patients. The full potential of PET to evaluate neurotransmitter function is as yet unrealized.},

TAA treatment increased by 33{\%} Vmax for high affinity, low capacity alpha-KG uptake, without influencing its Km. The increase of the uptake capacity for alpha-KG may represent a response of the GLUergic nerve terminals to the decreased cerebral alpha-KG content, which during HE is associated with depressed activity of pyruvate carboxylase, an enzyme that replenishes alpha-KG in astrocytes. The result is thus consistent with the notion that HE affects the astroglial control of GLUergic neurotransmission. The Km and Vmax for the low affinity, high capacity GLN uptake was not affected by TAA treatment.},

abstract = {The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy(HE) is unclear. However gut flora changes, inflammation and neuro-glial injury have been implicated. The aim was to evaluate factors that were associated with HE recurrence after lactulose withdrawal by analyzing the clinical phenotype, stool microbiome and systemic metabolome longitudinally. HE patients on a standard diet who were adherent on lactulose underwent characterization of their phenotype [cognition, inflammatory cytokines, in-vivo brain MR spectroscopy(MRS)], gut microbiome (stool Multitag Pyrosequencing) and metabolome (urine/serum ex-vivo MRS) analysis while on lactulose and on days 2, 14 and 30 post-withdrawal. Patients whose HE recurred post-withdrawal were compared to those without recurrence. We included seven men (53 +/- 8 years) who were adherent on lactulose after a precipitated HE episode were included. HE recurred in three men 32 +/- 6 days post-withdrawal. In-vivo brain MRS showed increased glutamine+glutamate (Glx) and decreased myoinositol with a reduction in stool Faecalibacterium spp., post-withdrawal. HE recurrence was predicted by poor baseline inhibitory control and block design performance and was associated with a shift of choline metabolism from tri-methylamine oxide formation towards the development of di-methylglycine, glycine and creatinine. This was accompanied by a mixed effect on the immune response (suppressed IL-10 and Th1/Th2/Th17 response). The correlation network showed Prevotella to be linked to improved cognition and decreased inflammation in patients without HE recurrence. We conclude that lactulose withdrawal results in worsening cognition, mixed inflammatory response effect, lowered stool Faecalibacterium and increase in MR-measurable brain Glx. HE recurrence post-lactulose withdrawal can be predicted by baseline cognitive performance and is accompanied by disrupted choline metabolism.},

abstract = {Chronic hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with a substantial increase in the brain L-tryptophan (L-TRP) level. Moreover, a supranormal L-TRP hydroxylating activity in the brain suggests an induced enzymatic process in chronic HE. GTP-cyclohydrolase I (GTPCHI) and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) are two major factors besides L-TRP that are involved in regulating the brain L-TRP hydroxylating activity. We therefore determined the GTPCHI activity, the total biopterin and the BH4 concentrations in the neocortex and mesencephalon-pons of portacaval shunted (PCS) rats. The encephalopathic component in PCS rats was accounted for by studying open field behaviour. The acute effects of a single parenteral L-TRP challenge were also evaluated. The basal GTPCHI activities in PCS rats were decreased bu 50{\%} (p < 0.05) compared to controls in both investigated brain regions. No significant alterations in brain total biopterin or BH4 levels were present. The PCS rats exhibited a clearly reduced spontaneous locomotor activity. After the exogenous L-TRP load only a lower GTPCHI activity in the neocortex of PCS rats was recorded. We conclude that a perturbation in the brain biopterin metabolism is concomitantly present with behavioural abnormalities in the chronic PCS condition and that the acute effects of a superimposed L-TRP load do not aggravate these disturbances.},

It is generally accepted that hyperammonaemia plays a major role, however there are a multitude of metabolic perturbations present. To determine the contribution of hyperammonaemia to mHE symptom development, ten healthy males (Age:25 +/- 5 yrs, BM:76.3 +/- 7.1 kg, Height:178.6 +/- 4.5 cm, mean +/- SD) received two 4 h intravenous infusions of either a 2{\%} ammonium chloride solution (AMM) or a placebo (PLA;0.9{\%} sodium chloride) using a double blind cross-over design. Sensations of fatigue were measured at baseline, 2 and 4 h using the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF) questionnaire. Learning {\&} memory, motor control and cognition were assessed using Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVL), Continuous Compensatory Tracking (COMPTRACK) Task and Inhibitory Control Test (ICT) respectively. Arterialised venous blood samples were collected every hour, and analysed for ammonia concentration. There was a significantly higher plasma ammonia concentration in the AMM trial than the PLA trial at every time point during the infusion, peaking at 2 h (57 +/- 4 mumol/L PLA, 225 +/- 14 mumol/L AMM; p < 0.05). At 2 h there were significantly higher sensations of general fatigue (Z = -2.527, p = 0.008, 2 tailed) and physical fatigue (Z = -2.156, p = 0.027, 2 tailed), and lower sensations of vigour (Z = -2.456, p = 0.012, 2 tailed) for the AMM trial. There were no significant effects on the performance of the psychological tasks. These results demonstrate that hyperammonaemia in the absence of other complications induces significant sensations of fatigue but does not cause the typically observed performance impairment in individuals with mHE.

abstract = {It is well known that glutamatergic excitotoxicity and oxidative stress are implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). The nucleoside guanosine exerts neuroprotective effects through the antagonism against glutamate neurotoxicity and antioxidant properties. In this study, we evaluated the neuroprotective effect of guanosine in an animal model of chronic HE. Rats underwent bile duct ligation (BDL) and 2 weeks later they were treated with i.p. injection of guanosine 7.5 mg/kg once a day for 1-week. We evaluated the effects of guanosine in HE studying several aspects: a) animal behavior using open field and Y-maze tasks; b) brain rhythm changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings; c) purines and glutamate levels in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF); and d) oxidative stress parameters in the brain. BDL rats presented increased levels of glutamate, purines and metabolites in the CSF, as well as increased oxidative damage. Guanosine was able not only to prevent these effects but also to attenuate the behavioral and EEG impairment induced by BDL. Our study shows the neuroprotective effects of systemic administration of guanosine in a rat model of HE and highlights the involvement of purinergic system in the physiopathology of this disease.},

abstract = {Reliable and accurate prediction of time series over large future horizons has become the new frontier of the forecasting discipline. Current approaches to long-term time series forecasting rely either on iterated predictors, direct predictors or, more recently, on the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) predictors. The iterated approach suffers from the accumulation of errors, the Direct strategy makes a conditional independence assumption, which does not necessarily preserve the stochastic properties of the time series, while the MIMO technique is limited by the reduced flexibility of the predictor. The paper compares the direct and MIMO strategies and discusses their respective limitations to the problem of long-term time series prediction. It also proposes a new methodology that is a sort of intermediate way between the Direct and the MIMO technique. The paper presents the results obtained with the ESTSP 2007 competition dataset.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy is the main cognitive dysfunction in cirrhotic patients associated with impaired prognosis. Hyperammonemia plus inflammatory response do play a crucial role on hepatic encephalopathy. However, in some patients HE appeared without hyperammonemia and patients with increased levels of ammonia could not show cognitive dysfunction. This has led to investigate other factors that could act in a synergistic way. Diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance are characterized by releasing and enhancing these pro-inflammatory cytokines and, additionally, has been related to hepatic encephalopathy. Indeed, patients with diabetes showed raised risk of over hepatic encephalopathy in comparison with non-cirrhotics. Type 2 diabetes mellitus could impair hepatic encephalopathy by different mechanisms that include: a) increasing glutaminase activity; b) impairing gut motility and promoting constipation, intestinal bacterial overgrowth and bacterial translocation. Despite of insufficient clarity about the practicability of anti-diabetic therapy and the most efficacious therapy, we would have to pay a special attention to the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance in cirrhotic patients.},

abstract = {Both acute and chronic liver failure induce cerebral complications known as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and thought to selectively involve brain astrocytes. Alterations of astrocytic-neuronal cross talk occurs affecting brain function. In acute liver failure, astrocyte undergo swelling, which results in increased intracranial pressure and may lead to brain herniation. In chronic liver failure, Alzheimer-type II astrocytosis is a characteristic change. Neurosteroids (NS) synthesized in the brain mainly by astrocytes independent of peripheral steroidal sources (adrenals and gonads) are suggested to play a role in HE. NS bind and modulate different types of membrane receptors. Effects on the gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)-A receptor complex are the most extensively studied. For example, the NS tetrahydroprogesterone (allopregnanolone), and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) are potent positive allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors. As a consequence of modulation of these receptors, NS are well-known to modulate inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Some NS bind to intracellular receptors, and in this way may also regulate gene expression. In HE, it has been well documented that neurotransmission and gene expression alterations occur during the progression of the disease. This review summarizes findings of relevance for the involvement of NS in human and experimental HE.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome which develops in patients with severe liver diseases and/or portal-systemic shunting. Minimal HE, the earliest manifestation of HE, has drawn increasing attention in the last decade. Minimal HE is associated with a series of brain functional changes, such as attention, working memory, and so on. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI), especially resting-state fMRI has been used to explore the brain functional changes of HE, yielding important insights for understanding pathophysiological mechanisms and functional reorganization of HE. This paper briefly reviews the principles of BOLD fMRI, potential applications of resting-state fMRI with advanced post-processing algorithms such as regional homogeneity, amplitude of low frequency fluctuation, functional connectivity and future research perspective in this field.},

abstract = {Although ammonia is considered the main factor involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), it correlates well with the severity of HE in acute liver failure, but not in chronic liver disease. Oxidative stress is another factor believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of this syndrome; it represents an imbalance between the production and neutralization of reactive oxygen species, which leads to cellular dysfunction. In the setting of liver disease, oxidative stress represents a systemic phenomenon induced by several mechanisms: decreased antioxidant synthesis, increased systemic release of oxidant enzymes, generation of reactive oxygen species, and impaired neutrophil function. High ammonia concentrations induce cerebral oxidative stress, thus contributing to severe hepatic encephalopathy, as observed in acute liver failure. In chronic liver disease, significantly lower degrees of hyperammonemia (<500 muM) do not induce cerebral nor systemic oxidative stress. Data from both animal and human studies sustain that there is a synergistic effect between systemic oxidative stress, and ammonia that is implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy.},

For comparison, high-affinity uptake of Glu and Asp was determined in human hippocampal brain tissue obtained at autopsy from cirrhotic patients dying in hepatic coma and from control brains free from neurological, psychiatric, or hepatic diseases. Sera and CSF from patients with chronic liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) were seen to reduce dramatically Glu and Asp uptake into rat hippocampal dendritic layers. A close inverse relationship was found to exist between the level of ammonia in the sera and the inhibition of uptake, both phenomena correlating highly with the extent of liver failure. The present findings, obtained after dilution of sera from patients with HE while maintaining initial ammonium levels, elucidate, however, that ammonia alone cannot account for the reduction in Glu/Asp uptake capacity. The inhibition of Asp uptake into human hippocampal formation of patients dying in hepatic coma was even more pronounced when compared to that found in rat hippocampus incubated in sera and CSF from patients. Glu/Asp uptake into brain tissue is supposed to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of HE accompanying liver dysfunctions.},

abstract = {Neuroinflammation plays a main role in neurological deficits in rats with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) due to portacaval shunt (PCS). Treating PCS rats with SB239063, an inhibitor of MAP-kinase-p38, reduces microglial activation and brain inflammatory markers and restores cognitive and motor function. The translocator protein-(18-kDa) (TSPO) is considered a biomarker of neuroinflammation. TSPO is increased in brain of PCS rats and of cirrhotic patients that died in hepatic coma. Rats with MHE show strong microglial activation in cerebellum and milder in other areas when assessed by MHC-II immunohistochemistry. This work aims were assessing: 1) whether binding of TSPO ligands is selectively increased in cerebellum in PCS rats; 2) whether treatment with SB239063 reduces binding of TSPO ligands in PCS rats; 3) which cell type (microglia, astrocytes) increases TSPO expression. Quantitative autoradiography was used to assess TSPO-selective 3H-(R)-PK11195 binding to different brain areas. TSPO expression increased differentially in PCS rats, reaching mild expression in striatum or thalamus and very high levels in cerebellum. TSPO was expressed in astrocytes and microglia. Treatment with SB239063 did not reduces 3[H]-PK11195 binding in PCS rats. SB239063 reduces microglial activation and levels of inflammatory markers, but not binding of TSPO ligands. This indicates that SB239063-induced neuroinflammation reduction in PCS rats is not mediated by effects on TSPO. Also, enhanced TSPO expression is not always associated with cognitive or motor deficits. If enhanced TSPO expression plays a role in mechanisms leading to neurological alterations in MHE, SB239063 would interfere these mechanisms at a later step.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of cirrhosis. The degree of neuro-psychiatric impairment is highly variable and its clinical staging subjective. We investigated whether eye movement response times-saccadic latencies-could serve as an indicator of encephalopathy. We studied the association between saccadic latency, liver function and paper- and pencil tests in 70 patients with cirrhosis and 31 patients after liver transplantation. The tests included the porto-systemic encephalopathy (PSE-) test, critical flicker frequency, MELD score and ammonia concentration. A normal range for saccades was established in 31 control subjects. Clinical and biochemical parameters of liver, blood, and kidney function were also determined. Median saccadic latencies were significantly longer in patients with liver cirrhosis when compared to patients after liver transplantation (244 ms vs. 278 ms p < 0.001). Both patient groups had prolonged saccadic latency when compared to an age matched control group (175 ms). The reciprocal of median saccadic latency (mu) correlated with PSE tests, MELD score and critical flicker frequency. A significant correlation between the saccadic latency parameter early slope (sigma(E)) that represents the prevalence of early saccades and partial pressure of ammonia was also noted. Psychometric test performance, but not saccadic latency, correlated with blood urea and sodium concentrations. Saccadic latency represents an objective and quantitative parameter of hepatic encephalopathy. Unlike psychometric test performance, these ocular responses were unaffected by renal function and can be obtained clinically within a matter of minutes by non-trained personnel.},

abstract = {Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is intermittently present in up to 2/3 of patients with chronic liver disease. It impairs their daily living and can be treated. However, there is no consensus on diagnostic criteria except that psychometric methods are required. We compared two easy-to-perform reproducible bedside methods: the critical flicker frequency (CFF) and continuous reaction times (CRT) tests. A CFF <39 Hz and CRT-index <1.9 (index: the ratio 50/(90 minus 10) percentiles of reaction times) indicates cerebral dysfunction. 154 patients with acute or chronic liver disease with out overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) underwent both tests at the same occasion. Both tests were abnormal in 20{\%} of the patients and both tests were normal in 40{\%} of the patients. In more than 1/3 the two tests were not in agreement as CFF classified 32{\%} and CRT-index classified 48{\%} of the patients as having MHE (p < 0.005). The two tests were weakly linearly correlated (r(2) = 0.14, p < 0.001) and neither test correlated with the metabolic liver function measured by the Galactose Elimination Capacity (GEC), nor with the blood ammonia concentration. Both tests identified a large fraction of the patients as having MHE and cleared only 40{\%}. The two tests did not show concordant results, likely because they describe different aspects of MHE: the CFF gives a measure of astrocytic metabolic state and hence pathogenic aspects of MHE, whereas the CRT measures a composite key performance, viz. the ability of reacting appropriately to a sensory stimulus. The choice of test depends on the information needed in the clinical and scientific care and study of the patients.},

abstract = {Benzodiazepines of natural origin (NBZDs) have been found in human blood and brains as well as in medicinal plants and foods. In plasma and brain tissue there are i.e. diazepam and nordiazepam equal to commercial drugs but there are also other benzodiazepine-like compounds termed "endozepines", which act as agonists at the benzodiazepine receptors of central type (CBR). A synthetic pathway for the production of NBZDs has not yet been found, but it has been suggested that micro-organisms may synthesize molecules with benzodiazepine-like structures. Hence NBZDs could be of both endogenous and exogenous source and be considered as natural anxyolitic and sedative. Interestingly there are also natural compounds, such as the polypeptide Diazepam Binding Inhibitor (DBI) acting as an "inversive agonist" implicated in fair and panic disorders. It has been suggested that NBZDs may play a role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Multidirectional studies evaluated NBZDs levels (1) in the blood of normal subjects, of cirrhotic with or without HE and in commercial benzodiazepine consumers; (2) in the blood of cirrhotic treated or not with a non-absorbable antibiotic; (3) in several constituents of our diet. In conclusion, NBZDs increase sometime in cirrhotics with or without HE but they reach concentrations not higher than those found in commercial benzodiazepines consumers. Hence NBZDs must be considered as occasional precipitating factor of HE and benzodiazepine antagonists only symptomatic drugs. The finding that NBZDs may be in part synthesized by intestinal bacterial flora and in part constituent of our diet underlines the importance to feed cirrhotic patients with selected food.},

Whether the "residual effects" of HE, degenerative brain injury or independent neurological insults are causing post transplant neurological deficits is not easy to discern. As more emphasis is being put on maintaining brain 'status' after liver transplantation, we are finding confirmation of the largely reversible nature of HE. But, enough important exceptions to this rule are occurring to make further research on this topic mandatory.},

abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

With regard to the shuttle enzymes the response to ammonium ions in vitro (3mM NH4Cl) was observed in nonsynaptic mitochondria only, and was manifested by a 27{\%} decrease of AAT activity and a 16{\%} decrease in MDH activity. By contrast, both in vivo conditions primarily affected the synaptic mitochondrial enzymes: TAA-induced HE produced a 26{\%} decrease of synaptic mitochondrial AAT and a 50{\%} decrease of synaptic mitochondrial MDH. Hyperammonemia inhibited synaptic mitochondrial AAT by 30{\%} and synaptic mitochondrial MDH by 45{\%}. HE produced no effect at all in nonsynaptic mitochondria while hyperammonemia produced a 30{\%} increase in the AAT activity, but no changes in MDH. All the experimental conditions affected the nonsynaptic mitochondria PC: ammonium chloride in vitro produced a 20{\%} decrease, TAA-induced HE--a 30{\%} decrease, whereas hyperammonemia inhibited the enzyme by 53{\%}. The PC activity in synaptic mitochondria was very low (about 2{\%} of that measured in nonsynaptic mitochondria), which is consistent with the primarily astrocytic localization of the enzyme.},

Blood ammonia is a valid over-all biomarker of HE and thus is regularly determined in clinical trials. The neurometabolites affected in HE can be assessed in vivo by proton magnetic spectroscopy. The aim of this study was to show the effect of the ammonia lowering drug L-ornithine-L-aspartate (OA) on the cerebral glutamate+glutamine/creatine (Glu+GLN/Cr) ratio. In an open clinical trial (pilot study), 15 patients with stable HE were treated with an infusion of 40 g OA over 8 h (5 g/h). Immediately before and 6-8 (mean 6.8) h after start of the infusion, spectroscopy of the parietal white matter was performed and arterial blood ammonia quantified. Glu+GLN/Cr-ratios correlated significantly with ammonia data (Spearman's correlation coefficient rs = 0.72, p < 0.001). Likewise, the OA induced changes (versus baseline before infusion) in blood ammonia level and in Glu+GLN/Cr-ratios correlated significantly rs = 0.54, p = 0.0375). Magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy assesses the neurometabolite variation present in HE. OA induced changes in cerebral Glu+GLN/ Cr-ratio were significantly correlated with the drug effects on arterial blood ammonia. These pilot data indicate that MR spectroscopy detects a specific biomarker of HE that may reflect the extent of the cerebral alterations associated with the disease.},

There is an enormous amount of textual data available in machine readable format which can be easily accessed via the Internet or databases. This ranges from scientific articles, abstracts and books to memos, letters, online forums, mailing lists, blogs, and other communication media delivering sensible information. Text mining is a highly interdisciplinary research field utilizing techniques from computer science, linguistics, and statistics. For the latter R is one of the leading computing environments offering a broad range of statistical methods. However, until recently, R has lacked an explicit framework for text mining purposes. This has changed with the tm (Feinerer, 2008; Feinerer et al., 2008) package which provides a text mining infrastructure for R. This allows R users to work efficiently with texts and corresponding meta data and transform the texts into structured representations where existing R methods can be applied, e.g., for clustering or classification. In this article we will give a short overview of the tm package. Then we will present two exemplary text mining applications, one in the field of stylometry and authorship attribution, the second is an analysis of a mailing list. Our aim is to show that tm provides the necessary abstraction over the actual text management so that the reader can use his own texts for a wide variety of text mining techniques.},

abstract = {A decreased ratio of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) to aromatic amino acids (AAA) is considered an important pathogenetic factor in hepatic encephalopathy (HE). A relationship between the deranged BCAA/AAA ratio and dopaminergic dysfunction through the formation of "false" neurotransmitters has been postulated. The intermediate lobe of the pituitary is more pronounced in dogs than in humans and because it is primarily under dopaminergic inhibitory influence, it may serve as an indicator of alterations in dopaminergic neurotransmission. We investigated the effects of a diet with a high BCAA/AAA ratio (HR) and an isonitrogenous diet with a low BCAA/AAA ratio (LR) on several physical and biochemical parameters including pituitary function in dogs with portocaval shunts and 40{\%} hepatectomy and in sham-operated pair-fed controls, in a double-blind, randomized cross-over study. Portocaval-shunted dogs had hyperammonemia (33+/-3 microM (mean +/- SEM) before and 214+/-21 after surgery)) and signs of HE. Their BCAA/AAA ratio in plasma and CSF decreased from 4.3+/-0.3 and 2.3+/-0.3 before surgery to 1.3+/-0.1 and 0.5+/-0.1 after surgery, respectively. These parameters remained unaltered in the control dogs. The consumption of the LR diet was significantly higher than consumption of the HR diet. In the portocaval-shunted dogs, plasma ammonia concentration was higher on the HR diet than on the LR diet (344+/-52 v 246+/-45) and the HE grade was worse. The BCAA/AAA ratio remained abnormal in HE dogs during the feeding of both diets. The basal and haloperidol-stimulated release of alpha-melanotropin and cortisol in plasma were not significantly different between or within groups during any period. In contrast, urinary cortisol excretion was increased in the HE dogs after surgery (urinary cortisol:creatinine ratio (x10(-6)) 8.5+/-1.4 before and 30.4+/-8.9 after surgery). The basal plasma concentration of adrenocorticotropin in HE dogs was decreased after surgery (68.3+/-10.2 ng/L before and 40.8+/-4.4 after surgery). This indicates a non-pituitary-dependent hyperresponsiveness of the adrenals. We conclude from these results that chronic HE in dogs is not associated with an abnormal dopaminergic neurotransmission at least at the level of the pituitary, and that it is not the content of the dietary neutral amino acids but rather the total protein intake that may have a beneficial effect on HE.},

Hippocrates 2500 years ago described 'encephalopathy' simply translated as 'inside head suffering.' Over 1500 papers have been written on hepatic encephalopathy since 1966, but only a minority of these actually refer to the original observation of hepatic encephalopathy and the link with ammonia made by Marcel Nencki and Ivan Pavlov in 1893 with very little acknowledgement being made to the early landmark studies which described the importance of the muscle and kidneys in maintaining ammonia homeostasis as well as the liver and gut. Furthermore, infection was recognized as being an important modulator of brain function by the ancient Greek physicians and philosophers. This review focuses upon the original experiments of Nencki and Pavlov and describes how they fit into what we understand about the pathophysiology and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy today.},

abstract = {The functional activity of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor-chloride  ionophore complex was studied in rats with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) secondary to thioacetamide-induced fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). Muscimol stimulation and benzodiazepine potentiation of GABA receptor-mediated 36Cl- uptake into cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes was compared in HE and control rats. [3H]Flumazenil binding assays were conducted to determine whether the levels of endogenous benzodiazepine-like ligands in extracts of cortex were increased with stages of encephalopathy in this animal model of HE. In both control and HE rats maximal uptake of 36Cl- via the GABAA receptor complex occurred at muscimol concentrations of 30 microM. Potentiation of muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake into synaptoneurosomes by diazepam (5 microM) was equivalent in both groups. Aqueous extracts of proteolytically digested homogenates of cerebral cortices prepared from control and HE rats were effective in stimulating 36Cl- uptake into synaptoneurosomes. Alkaline organic extracts of proteolytically digested homogenates of cerebral cortices from HE rats were more effective than corresponding extracts from controls at inhibiting the binding of [3H]flumazenil. Inhibition of [3H] fumazenil binding by organic extracts derived from the cerebral cortices of HE rats did not increase with progression of encephalopathy. The results show that muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake into synaptoneurosomes and, consequently, GABAA receptor-mediated chloride channel function are not significantly altered in the model of HE studied and are consistent with the hypothesis that HE results in an increased availability of one or more endogenous ligands which can augment GABA receptor-gated chloride conductance.},

A review of the literature on this subject is reported. The visually interpreted EEG is only of benefit in the late stages of hepatic encephalopathy. EEG spectral analysis allows identification of all stages of the condition. Brainstem auditory evoked responses are normal in encephalopathy. Visual evoked responses show an increase in the latency and eventual loss of individual component waves as encephalopathy progresses. Somatosensory evoked responses show a progressive prolongation of peak and inter-peak latency which correlates with the severity of encephalopathy. The auditory P300 evoked response shows an increased latency with the development of hepatic encephalopathy. Event related potentials provide objective diagnostic markers of the development of hepatic encephalopathy. The increased use of this technology in the assessment of patients with this condition should be of clinical benefit in its management.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) represents a nervous system disorder caused due to liver dysfunction. HE is broadly classified as acute/overt and moderate-minimal HE. Since HE syndrome severely affects quality of life of the patients and it may be life threatening, it is important to develop effective therapeutic strategy against HE. Mainly ammonia neurotoxicity is considered accountable for HE. Increased level of ammonia in the brain activates glutamate-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor (NMDAR) pathway leading to Ca2+ influx, energy deficit and oxidative stress in the post synaptic neurons. Moreover, NMDAR blockage has been found to be a poor therapeutic option, as this neurotransmitter receptor plays important role in maintaining normal neurophysiology of the brain. Thus, searching new molecular players in HE pathogenesis is of current concern. There is an evolving concept about roles of the trans-membrane channels in the pathogenesis of a number of neurological complications. Pannexin1 (Panx1) is one of them and has been described to be implicated in stroke, epilepsy and ischemia. Importantly, the pathogenesis of these complications relates to some extent with NMDAR over activation. Thus, it is speculated that HE pathogenesis might also involve Panx1. Indeed, some recent observations in the animal models of HE provide support to this argument. Since opening of Panx1 channel is mostly associated with the neuronal dysfunctions, down regulation of this channel could serve as a relevant therapeutic strategy without producing any serious side effects. In the review article an attempt has been made to summarize the current information on implication of Panx1 in the brain disorders and its prospects for being examined as pharmacological target in HE pathogenesis.},

abstract = {According to one popular theory, hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is partly caused by  an imbalance in plasma amino acid levels. The Fischer's ratio between branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) and aromatic amino acids (AAAs) correlates with the degree of HE; the lower Fischer's ratio, the higher the grade of HE. Extra-corporeal liver support systems, like MARS(R)-albumin dialysis (Molecular Adsorbents Recirculating System), can improve HE. The MARS(R) system uses a hyperosmolar albumin circuit to remove both water-soluble and albumin-bound substances. Plasma levels of neuroactive amino acids were analyzed in 82 consecutive patients with life-threatening liver failure admitted to our ICU. All patients fulfilled our indications for MARS treatment and most also fulfilled the criteria for liver transplantation (LTx). In patients with acute liver failure (ALF), as compared to those with acute decompensation of chronic liver failure (AcOChr), levels of leucine and isoleucine were significantly higher before MARS(R) treatment. In all patients, before MARS(R) treatment the higher the grade of HE grade the lower was the Fischer's ratio and higher were the levels of inhibitory neuroactive amino acids. During MARS(R) treatments the Fischer's ratio increased, and the grade of HE decreased. The increase in Fischer's ratio was mainly due to the decrease in AAAs. The plasma levels of neuroactive amino acids, methionine, glutamine, glutamate, histidine and taurine decreased during MARS(R)-treatment. In this study MARS(R)-albumin dialysis had a favorable effect on the plasma amino acid profile of patients with HE.},

We applied a flexible family of statistical models to elucidate the contribution of inter- and intra-individual variables on cognitive functioning in healthy volunteers and patients at risk for hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Sixty-five volunteers (32 patients with cirrhosis and 33 healthy volunteers) were assessed by means of the Inhibitory Control Task (ICT). A Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) was fitted for jointly modeling the mean and the intra-variability of Reaction Times (RTs) as a function of socio-demographic and task related covariates. Furthermore, a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) was fitted for modeling accuracy. When controlling for the covariates, patients without minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) did not differ from patients with MHE in the low-demanding condition, both in terms of RTs and accuracy. Moreover, they showed a significant decline in accuracy compared to the control group. Compared to patients with MHE, patients without MHE showed faster RTs and higher accuracy only in the high-demanding condition. The results revealed that the application of GAMLSS and GLMM models are able to capture subtle cognitive alterations, previously not detected, in patients' subclinical pathologies.},

abstract = {It is generally assumed that neuronal cell death is minimal in liver failure and  is insufficient to account for the neuropsychiatric symptoms characteristic of hepatic encephalopathy. However, contrary to this assumption, neuronal cell damage and death are well documented in liver failure patients, taking the form of several distinct clinical entities namely acquired (non-Wilsonian) hepatocerebral degeneration, cirrhosis-related Parkinsonism, post-shunt myelopathy and cerebellar degeneration. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that liver failure contributes to the severity of neuronal loss in Wernicke's encephalopathy. The long-standing nature of the thalamic and cerebellar lesions, over 80{\%} of which are missed by routine clinical evaluation, together with the probability that they are nutritional in origin, underscores the need for careful nutritional management (adequate dietary protein, Vitamin B(1)) in liver failure patients. Mechanisms identified with the potential to cause neuronal cell death in liver failure include NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity, lactic acidosis, oxidative/nitrosative stress and the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The extent of neuronal damage in liver failure may be attenuated by compensatory mechanisms that include down-regulation of NMDA receptors, hypothermia and the presence of neuroprotective steroids such as allopregnanolone. These findings suggest that some of the purported "sequelae" of liver transplantation (gait ataxia, memory loss, confusion) could reflect preexisting neuropathology.},

abstract = {The term minimal hepatic encephalopathy refers to the subtle changes in cognitive function, electrophysiological parameters, cerebral neurochemical/neurotransmitter homeostasis, cerebral blood flow, metabolism, and fluid homeostasis that can be observed in patients with cirrhosis who have no clinical evidence of hepatic encephalopathy. Use of this term emphasizes the fact that the entity of hepatic encephalopathy is a single syndrome with quantitatively distinct features relating to severity. The absence of clinical evidence of hepatic encephalopathy is key to the diagnosis and can only be determined by a detailed assessment of the patients' history and a comprehensive neurological assessment of consciousness, cognitive, and motor function. The neuropsychological features of minimal hepatic encephalopathy point to a disorder of executive functioning, particularly selective attention and psychomotor speed, but other abnormalities may be observed. Alterations in electrophysiological variables have been described; endogenous evoked potentials are, in principle, more likely to reflect the presence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy, since they reflect cognitive phenomena rather than mere stimulus conduction but the specificity of the changes observed is unclear at present. Changes have also been described in the execution of diadochokinetic movements and in the capacity to discriminate flickering light, both of which may have diagnostic potential. The changes observed in cerebral blood flow and metabolism in SPET, PET, and 1H and 31P MRS studies reflect the pathogenic process that underlies the condition rather than providing diagnostic information. Similarly, the morphological brain abnormalities identified in this population, including mild brain oedema, hyperintensity of the globus pallidus and other subcortical nuclei observed in cerebral MR studies, and the central and cortical atrophy observed in neural imaging studies, are unlikely to have diagnostic utility. The presence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy is not without clinical consequence; it has a detrimental effect on health-related quality of life, the ability to perform complex tasks such as driving, and on outcome.},

The method has been in clinical use for decades in Denmark for the stated purpose. The method is a 10-minutes, computerised registration of a series of motor reaction times to an auditory stimulus, with results reported as the CRTindex (50 percentile/(90-10) percentile) as a parameter of reaction time variability. The index is a measure of alertness stability and is used to assess attention and cognition deficits. The CRTindex identifies half of patients in a Danish cohort with chronic liver disease, as having m/cHE, a normal value safely precludes HE, it has a broad outcome span reflecting the degree of brain impairment, it shows no learning effect, and it is independent on age and gender. The CRTindex is, therefore, a candidate tool for routine screening, detecting, grading, and monitoring m/cHE. Still, however, further methodological and clinical validation trials are required and are currently being conducted.},

abstract = {The term machine learning refers to a set of topics dealing with the creation and evaluation of algorithms that facilitate pattern recognition, classification, and prediction, based on models derived from existing data. Two facets of mechanization should be acknowledged when considering machine learning in broad terms. Firstly, it is intended that the classification and prediction tasks can be accomplished by a suitably programmed computing machine. That is, the product of machine learning is a classifier that can be feasibly used on available hardware. Secondly, it is intended that the creation of the classifier should itself be highly mechanized, and should not involve too much human input. This second facet is inevitably vague, but the basic objective is that the use of automatic algorithm construction methods can minimize the possibility that human biases could affect the selection and performance of the algorithm. Both the creation of the algorithm and its operation to classify objects or predict events are to be based on concrete, observable data. The history of relations between biology and the field of machine learning is long and complex. An early technique 1 for machine learning called the perceptron constituted an attempt to model actual neuronal behavior, and the field of artificial neural network (ANN) design emerged from this attempt. Early work on the analysis of translation initiation sequences 2 employed the perceptron to define criteria for start sites in Escherichia coli. Further artificial neural network architectures such as the adaptive resonance theory (ART) 3 and neocognitron 4 were inspired from the organization of the visual nervous system. In the intervening years, the flexibility of machine learning techniques has grown along with mathematical frameworks for measuring their reliability, and it is natural to hope that machine learning methods will improve the efficiency of discovery and understanding in the mounting volume and complexity of biological data. This tutorial is structured in four main components. Firstly, a brief section reviews definitions and mathematical prerequisites. Secondly, the field of supervised learning is described. Thirdly, methods of unsupervised learning are reviewed. Finally, a section reviews methods and examples as implemented in the open source data analysis and visualization language R (http://www.r-project.org).},

abstract = {Patients with chronic liver disease manifest a high incidence (> 75{\%}) of pallidal signal hyperintensity on T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the intensity of which correlates with blood manganese levels and the presence of extrapyramidal symptoms. A major cause of pallidal hyperintensity on T1-weighted MRI is manganese deposition; chronic manganese intoxication in the absence of liver disease results in pallidal MR signal hyperintensity, in extrapyramidal symptoms and in selective effects on the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system in basal ganglia. Direct measurements in globus pallidus obtained at autopsy from patients with chronic liver disease who died in hepatic coma reveal 2 to 7-fold increases of pallidal manganese and a concomitant loss of dopamine D2 binding sites. Liver transplantation results in normalization of pallidal MR signals and of blood manganese levels. These findings suggest that (1) pallidal MR signal hyperintensity in patients with chronic liver disease is the result of manganese deposition and (2) alterations of dopaminergic function due to the toxic effects of manganese may contribute to the extrapyramidal symptoms in these patients.},

abstract = {genoud is an R function that combines evolutionary algorithm methods with a derivative-based (quasi-Newton) method to solve difficult optimization problems. genoud may also be used for optimization problems for which derivatives do not exist. genoud solves problems that are nonlinear or perhaps even discontinuous in the parameters of the function to be optimized. When the function to be optimized (for example, a log-likelihood) is nonlinear in the model's parameters, the function will generally not be globally concave and may have irregularities such as saddlepoints or discontinuities. Optimization methods that rely on derivatives of the objective function may be unable to find any optimum at all. Multiple local optima may exist, so that there is no guarantee that a derivative-based method will converge to the global optimum. On the other hand, algorithms that do not use derivative information (such as pure genetic algorithms) are for many problems needlessly poor at local hill climbing. Most statistical problems are regular in a neighborhood of the solution. Therefore, for some portion of the search space, derivative information is useful. The function supports parallel processing on multiple CPUs on a single machine or a cluster of computers.},

abstract = {Based on the reversal of hepatic encephalopathy in animal models with administration of specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, it has been postulated that this syndrome may be mediated by an endogenous benzodiazepine-like compound. In this study using a radio-receptor assay, evidence for the existence of this substance has been demonstrated in cerebrospinal fluid but not sera of rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy due to galactosamine-induced hepature failure. Cerebrospinal fluid from rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy caused 36.1 +/- 5.03{\%} displacement of 3H-Ro 15-1788 specific binding to cortical benzodiazepine receptors, compared to 11.7 +/- 0.76{\%} in control animals (P less than 0.01). The benzodiazepine receptor binding activity has been shown to behave as a competitive inhibitor of radiolabeled benzodiazepine receptor binding. The finding of endogenous benzodiazepine binding activity affords a potential explanation for the amelioration of hepatic encephalopathy in this model with the administration of benzodiazepine receptor antagonists.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric manifestation of acute and chronic liver failure. Ammonia plays a key role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy by inducing astrocyte swelling and/or sensitizing astrocytes to swelling by a heterogeneous panel of precipitating factors and conditions. Whereas astrocyte swelling in acute liver failure contributes to a clinically overt brain edema, a low grade glial edema without clinically overt brain edema is observed in hepatic encephalopathy in liver cirrhosis. Astrocyte swelling produces reactive oxygen and nitrogen oxide species (ROS/RNOS), which again increase astrocyte swelling, thereby creating a self-amplifying signaling loop. Astroglial swelling and ROS/RNOS increase protein tyrosine nitration and may account for neurotoxic effects of ammonia and other precipitants of hepatic encephalopathy. Recently, RNA oxidation and an increase of free intracellular zinc ([Zn(2+)](i)) were identified as further consequences of astrocyte swelling and ROS/RNOS production. An elevation of [Zn(2+)](i) mediates mRNA expression of metallothionein and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) induced by hypoosmotic astrocyte swelling. Further, Zn(2+) mediates RNA oxidation in ammonia-treated astrocytes. In the brain of hyperammonemic rats oxidized RNA localizes in part to perivascular astrocyte processes and to postsynaptic dendritic spines. RNA oxidation may impair postsynaptic protein synthesis, which is critically involved in learning and memory consolidation. RNA oxidation offers a novel explanation for multiple disturbances of neurotransmitter systems and gene expression and the cognitive deficits observed in hepatic encephalopathy.},

@article{Norenberg1998,
abstract = {While the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) remains elusive, there is considerable evidence pointing to a key role of ammonia-induced dysfunction of astrocytes in this condition. Deficits in the ability of astrocytes to take up glutamate from the extracellular space may lead to abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission. Furthermore, excessive stimulation of neuronal and glial glutamate receptors by elevated extracellular levels of glutamate may lead to excitotoxicity and greater glial dysfunction. Ammonia also causes upregulation of astroglial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) which is associated with increased production of neurosteroids. These neurosteroids have potent positive modulatory effects on the neuronal GABA(A) receptor which, combined with an ammonia-induced astroglial defect in GABA uptake, may result in enhanced GABAergic tone. Brain edema, associated with fulminant hepatic failure, may also result from astroglial abnormalities as the edema appears to be principally caused by swelling of these cells. Increased amounts of glutamine in astrocytes resulting from elevated brain ammonia levels may be a factor in this swelling. Other osmolytes such as glutathione may also be involved. Glial swelling may also result from NH4+ - and K+ -mediated membrane depolarization as well as by the actions of PBR agonists and neurosteroids. These findings show that an ammonia-induced gliopathy is a major factor in the pathogenesis of HE.},

abstract = {The term machine learning refers to a set of topics dealing with the creation and evaluation of algorithms that facilitate pattern recognition, classification, and prediction, based on models derived from existing data. Two facets of mechanization should be acknowledged when considering machine learning in broad terms. Firstly, it is intended that the classification and prediction tasks can be accomplished by a suitably programmed computing machine. That is, the product of machine learning is a classifier that can be feasibly used on available hardware. Secondly, it is intended that the creation of the classifier should itself be highly mechanized, and should not involve too much human input. This second facet is inevitably vague, but the basic objective is that the use of automatic algorithm construction methods can minimize the possibility that human biases could affect the selection and performance of the algorithm. Both the creation of the algorithm and its operation to classify objects or predict events are to be based on concrete, observable data. The history of relations between biology and the field of machine learning is long and complex. An early technique 1 for machine learning called the perceptron constituted an attempt to model actual neuronal behavior, and the field of artificial neural network (ANN) design emerged from this attempt. Early work on the analysis of translation initiation sequences 2 employed the perceptron to define criteria for start sites in Escherichia coli. Further artificial neural network architectures such as the adaptive resonance theory (ART) 3 and neocognitron 4 were inspired from the organization of the visual nervous system. In the intervening years, the flexibility of machine learning techniques has grown along with mathematical frameworks for measuring their reliability, and it is natural to hope that machine learning methods will improve the efficiency of discovery and understanding in the mounting volume and complexity of biological data. This tutorial is structured in four main components. Firstly, a brief section reviews definitions and mathematical prerequisites. Secondly, the field of supervised learning is described. Thirdly, methods of unsupervised learning are reviewed. Finally, a section reviews methods and examples as implemented in the open source data analysis and visualization language R (http://www.r-project.org).},

abstract = {Metabolic alterations in the brain underly many of the mechanisms leading to acute and chronic Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE). Controversy exists about the role of glutamine accumulation as a causal factor in HE. Glutamine formation contributes to detoxify ammonia, whereby anaplerotic mechanisms in the astrocytes have to be sufficient to replenish Krebs cycle intermediates. The application of ex vivo high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy permits direct measurements of metabolites and different metabolic pathways. Ex vivo (13)C-NMR studies in experimental animal models of acute and chronic HE have provided new insights. In an experimental rat model of ALF, (13)C isotopomer analysis of glucose metabolism showed that alterations of glucose flux through astrocytic pyruvate carboxylase might be linked to the pathogenesis of ALF as a limited anaplerotic flux in the brain, but not in the muscle, correlates with the development of brain edema. Moreover, (13)C-NMR data from a rat model of mild HE demonstrated relative differences in the pathway of glucose through pyruvate carboxylase in thalamus compared to frontal cortex, which might explain the vulnerability of this brain region compared to thalamus. These findings further support that glutamine accumulation might be not the primary cause of neurological symptoms in HE, and show that anaplerotic mechanisms could be essential for ammonia detoxification in HE.},

abstract = {Cyclic GMP (cGMP) modulates important cerebral processes including some forms of  learning and memory. cGMP pathways are strongly altered in hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Patients with liver cirrhosis show reduced intracellular cGMP in lymphocytes, increased cGMP in plasma and increased activation of soluble guanylate cyclase by nitric oxide (NO) in lymphocytes, which correlates with minimal HE assessed by psychometric tests. Activation of soluble guanylate cyclase by NO is also increased in cerebral cortex, but reduced in cerebellum, from patients who died with HE. This opposite alteration is reproduced in vivo in rats with chronic hyperammonemia or HE. A main pathway modulating cGMP levels in brain is the glutamate-NO-cGMP pathway. The function of this pathway is impaired both in cerebellum and cortex of rats with hyperammonemia or HE. Impairment of this pathway is responsible for reduced ability to learn some types of tasks. Restoring the pathway and cGMP levels in brain restores learning ability. This may be achieved by administering phosphodiesterase inhibitors (zaprinast, sildenafil), cGMP, anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen) or antagonists of GABAA receptors (bicuculline). These data support that increasing cGMP by safe pharmacological means may be a new therapeutic approach to improve cognitive function in patients with minimal or clinical HE.},

Ammonia has been considered central to its pathogenesis but recently an important role for its interaction with inflammatory responses and auto-regulation of cerebral hemodynamics has been suggested. Artificial liver support might be able to decrease ammonia and modulate inflammatory mediators and cerebral hemodynamics. Bioartificial liver support systems use hepatocytes in an extracorporeal device connected to the patient's circulation. Artificial liver support is intended to remove protein-bound toxins and water-soluble toxins without providing synthetic function. Both systems improve clinical and biochemical parameters and can be applied safely to patients. Clinical studies have shown that artificial liver support, especially albumin dialysis, is able to improve HE in acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure. Further studies are required to better understand the mechanism, however, artificial liver support can be added to the therapeutic bundle in treating HE.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy is seen as a clinical manifestation of a chronic low grade cerebral edema, which is thought to trigger disturbances of astrocyte function, glioneuronal communication, and finally HE symptoms. In cultured astrocytes, hypoosmotic swelling triggers a rapid oxidative stress response, which involves the action of NADPH oxidase isoenzymes, followed by tyrosine nitration of distinct astrocytic proteins. Oxidative stress and protein tyrosine nitration (PTN) are also observed in response to ammonia, inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha or interferons, and benzodiazepines with affinity to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). NMDA receptor activation was identified as upstream event in protein tyrosine nitration (PTN). Cerebral PTN is also found in vivo after administration of ammonia, benzodiazepines or lipopolysaccharide and in portocaval shunted rats. PTN predominantly affects astrocytes surrounding cerebral vessels with potential impact on blood-brain-barrier permeability. Among the tyrosine-nitrated proteins, glutamine synthetase, GAPDH, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and the PBR were identified. PTN of glutamine synthetase is associated with inactivation of the enzyme. Thus, factors known to trigger hepatic encephalopathy induce oxidative/nitrosative stress on astrocytes with protein modifications through PTN. The pathobiochemical relevance of astrocytic PTN for the development of HE symptoms remains to be established.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious complication of liver failure. HE manifests as a series of neuropsychiatric and neuromuscular symptoms including personality changes, sleep abnormalities, asterixis and muscle rigidity progressing through stupor to coma. The pathophysiologic basis of HE remains unclear. There is general agreement that ammonia plays a key role. In recent years, it has been suggested that oxidative/nitrosative stress constitutes part of the pathophysiologic cascade in HE. Direct evidence for oxidative/nitrosative stress in the pathogenesis of HE has been demonstrated in experimental animal models of acute or chronic liver failure. However, evidence from studies in HE patients is limited. This review summarizes this evidence for a role of oxidative/nitrosative stress in relation to ammonia toxicity and to the pathogenesis of HE.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric disorder that often occurs as a consequence of acute or chronic liver failure. Previous reports have suggested that alterations in amino acid neurotransmission, particularly glutamate, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of HE. The objectives of the present study were to test the hypothesis that extracellular glutamate concentration is increased during HE, and to determine if flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, alters the extracellular concentration of glutamate during HE. The experimental approach involved using microdialysis probes to measure rat hippocampal extracellular glutamate concentration. HE was brought about as a result of thioacetamide-induced liver failure. Thioacetamide produced behavioral and metabolic effects, such as somnolence, hyperventilation and hyperammonemia, consistent with stage three HE. Comparison with saline-treated rats demonstrated that HE was associated with a significant increase (p = 0.010) in extracellular hippocampal glutamate concentration. Administration of flumazenil caused a transient increase in arousal level, but did not affect the increase in glutamate concentration (p = 0.93). These results corroborate the theory that glutamate neurotransmission is altered during HE and suggest that the flumazenil arousal of HE rats is not mediated by a change in extracellular glutamate concentration.},

Twenty patients with HBV-related cirrhosis and MHE and 15 healthy controls were included in this study and underwent the resting-state fMRI scanning and diffusion tensor imaging. The functional connectivity between symmetric interhemispheric voxels was computed by a technique called voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), in which the time series for each voxel in one hemisphere was correlated with that of its homotopic voxel. Diffusion tensor imaging was conducted to measure the mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values in corpus callosum (CC). Compared with controls, MHE patients showed decreased regional VMHC in medial frontal gyrus, superior frontal gryus, anterior cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, postcentral gyrus, lingual gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus. MHE patients had significant decreased FA value in CC genu and CC splenium and increased MD value in CC genu. Pearson correlation analyses showed that the VMHC in anterior cingulate gyrus/medial frontal gyrus was correlated with FA/MD values of CC genu. These findings may suggest aberrant interhemispheric coordination in MHE and may provide new insight into the disease-related mechanisms.},

abstract = {Increased plasma and CSF concentrations of substances which bind to brain benzodiazepine receptors have previously been reported in cirrhotic patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). However, their relationship to previous intake of pharmaceutical benzodiazepines has not been clearly established. In the present study, plasma levels of benzodiazepine receptor ligands (BZRLs) were measured using a sensitive radioreceptor assay in 12 control subjects with no evidence of hepatic, neurological or psychiatric illness, 11 cirrhotic patients without HE, 24 cirrhotic patients with moderate (grade I-II) HE and in 45 cirrhotic patients with severe (grade II-IV) HE. In addition, CSF concentrations of BZRLs were measured in 8 cirrhotic patients with HE and an equal number of age-matched controls. Recent intake (within 10 days) of pharmaceutical benzodiazepines was assessed by detailed review of medical files, and interviews with the patient, at least one family member as well as the pharmacist. Significantly increased plasma concentrations of BZRLs were observed in cirrhotic patients with severe encephalopathy (p < 0.02) compared to controls and to cirrhotic patients without (or with mild) neurological impairment. Increased plasma BZRLs could be accounted for by prior exposure to benzodiazepine medication in all cases. CSF concentrations of BZRLs in cirrhotic patients were not significantly different from control values. These findings do not support a role for "endogenous" benzodiazepines in the pathogenesis of HE in chronic liver disease but suggest that pharmaceutic benzodiazepines administered to cirrhotic patients as sedatives or as part of endoscopic work-up could have contributed to the neurological impairment in some patients.},

abstract = {The prevalence of subclinical hepatic encephalopathy (SHE) varies according to the diagnostic tool used in its detection. Since a standardised approach to the diagnosis of SHE is not yet available, we compared psychometric tests and EEG spectral analysis. On the same day 32 cirrhotic patients without overt hepatic encephalopathy and 18 controls were assessed by psychometric tests, both standard and computerized (CPT), and by EEG spectral analysis (EEG-SA). The CPT, measuring reaction time (Rt) and errors (er), were Font, Choice1, Choice2 and Scan test. The standard psychometric tests were the number connection test (NCT), the Reitan-B test, the Line Tracing Test [for time: LTT(t) and for errors: LTT(er)], and the Symbol Digit test (SD). Both psychometric tests [Reitan-B test, LTT(er) and CPT but Font (Rt) and Choice2 (er)] and EEG-SA parameters [mean dominant frequency (MDF) and theta power (theta {\%})] significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with albumin plasma levels. LTT(er), Scan, Font, Choice1 and Choice2 were significantly related to theta {\%} and MDF. There was no control with positive EEG-SA, though one control was positive with LTT(t) and with the number of errors made during Font and Scan tests. The percentage of cirrhotics with positive EEG-SA was 34{\%} (CI95{\%} = 19-53), while 9-66{\%} were positive with psychometric tests, depending on the test considered. In spite of the correlation between neuropsychological and neurophysiological parameters, the diagnostic agreement between EEG-SA and each psychometric test was not high. IN CONCLUSION: 1) neurophysiological and neuropsychological impairment in cirrhotics without overt hepatic encephalopathy were found linked to each other and to hepatic dysfunction; 2) psychometric tests were not sufficiently good predictors of EEG alterations; therefore, neuropsychological tools can not substitute neurophysiological ones to detect CNS dysfunction in liver disease.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy is seen as a clinical manifestation of a chronic low grade cerebral edema, which is thought to trigger disturbances of astrocyte function, glioneuronal communication, and finally HE symptoms. In cultured astrocytes, hypoosmotic swelling triggers a rapid oxidative stress response, which involves the action of NADPH oxidase isoenzymes, followed by tyrosine nitration of distinct astrocytic proteins. Oxidative stress and protein tyrosine nitration (PTN) are also observed in response to ammonia, inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha or interferons, and benzodiazepines with affinity to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). NMDA receptor activation was identified as upstream event in protein tyrosine nitration (PTN). Cerebral PTN is also found in vivo after administration of ammonia, benzodiazepines or lipopolysaccharide and in portocaval shunted rats. PTN predominantly affects astrocytes surrounding cerebral vessels with potential impact on blood-brain-barrier permeability. Among the tyrosine-nitrated proteins, glutamine synthetase, GAPDH, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and the PBR were identified. PTN of glutamine synthetase is associated with inactivation of the enzyme. Thus, factors known to trigger hepatic encephalopathy induce oxidative/nitrosative stress on astrocytes with protein modifications through PTN. The pathobiochemical relevance of astrocytic PTN for the development of HE symptoms remains to be established.},

Such changes could reflect cell adaptation to excess ammonia or some other associated metabolic stress. The mRNA levels of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) decreased similarly in three different brain regions, whereas those of glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutaminase (GA) increased. The mRNA levels of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) were unchanged. The results indicate that some effect of liver damage, presumably hyperammonemia, affected the expression of some, but not all, genes associated with ammonia and glutamate metabolism in the brain. This adaptation of gene expression to secondary effects of ammonia on brain amino acid neurotransmitter metabolism or brain energy metabolism could play a role in the physiological changes observed in hepatic encephalopathy.},

abstract = {Cyclic GMP (cGMP) modulates important cerebral processes including some forms of  learning and memory. cGMP pathways are strongly altered in hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Patients with liver cirrhosis show reduced intracellular cGMP in lymphocytes, increased cGMP in plasma and increased activation of soluble guanylate cyclase by nitric oxide (NO) in lymphocytes, which correlates with minimal HE assessed by psychometric tests. Activation of soluble guanylate cyclase by NO is also increased in cerebral cortex, but reduced in cerebellum, from patients who died with HE. This opposite alteration is reproduced in vivo in rats with chronic hyperammonemia or HE. A main pathway modulating cGMP levels in brain is the glutamate-NO-cGMP pathway. The function of this pathway is impaired both in cerebellum and cortex of rats with hyperammonemia or HE. Impairment of this pathway is responsible for reduced ability to learn some types of tasks. Restoring the pathway and cGMP levels in brain restores learning ability. This may be achieved by administering phosphodiesterase inhibitors (zaprinast, sildenafil), cGMP, anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen) or antagonists of GABAA receptors (bicuculline). These data support that increasing cGMP by safe pharmacological means may be a new therapeutic approach to improve cognitive function in patients with minimal or clinical HE.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neurologic disease associated with hepatic dysfunction. Astroglial and neuronal alterations have been described in the basal ganglia in HE. Our study was performed to determine whether such alterations are mediated by nitric oxide (NO), by using an experimental model of HE (portacaval anastomosis [PCA]). The expression of the NO synthases (nNOS and iNOS) and the production of nitrotyrosine (NT) were evaluated in the striatum of rats exposed to PCA for 1 and 6 months. The expression of nNOS in the striatal neurons of PCA rats was increased compared to controls. nNOS expression was also detectable in astrocytes after 6 months of exposure to PCA. Whereas astroglial cells in the normal striatum showed no iNOS expression, iNOS was expressed in the astrocytes of PCA brains, mainly in perivascular processes at 6 months PCA exposure (demonstrated by colocalization with GFAP). The increased expression of both the nNOS and iNOS isoforms in PCA rats might indicate a critical role for NO in the pathomechanism of HE. To study the potential cell damage caused by NO, the deposition of NT in PCA-rats was analysed. Nitrotyrosine was detected in neurons although it was mainly seen in the astrocytes of PCA brains, in which double immunolabelling showed NT to be colocalized with GFAP. Thus, the present study shows the induction of iNOS and NT in astrocytes, which increases with the duration of PCA exposure. This suggests that the induced astroglial production of NO during PCA might be one of the main factors contributing to HE.},

Muscimol stimulation and benzodiazepine potentiation of GABA receptor-mediated 36Cl- uptake into cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes was compared in HE and control rats. [3H]Flumazenil binding assays were conducted to determine whether the levels of endogenous benzodiazepine-like ligands in extracts of cortex were increased with stages of encephalopathy in this animal model of HE. In both control and HE rats maximal uptake of 36Cl- via the GABAA receptor complex occurred at muscimol concentrations of 30 microM. Potentiation of muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake into synaptoneurosomes by diazepam (5 microM) was equivalent in both groups. Aqueous extracts of proteolytically digested homogenates of cerebral cortices prepared from control and HE rats were effective in stimulating 36Cl- uptake into synaptoneurosomes. Alkaline organic extracts of proteolytically digested homogenates of cerebral cortices from HE rats were more effective than corresponding extracts from controls at inhibiting the binding of [3H]flumazenil. Inhibition of [3H] fumazenil binding by organic extracts derived from the cerebral cortices of HE rats did not increase with progression of encephalopathy. The results show that muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake into synaptoneurosomes and, consequently, GABAA receptor-mediated chloride channel function are not significantly altered in the model of HE studied and are consistent with the hypothesis that HE results in an increased availability of one or more endogenous ligands which can augment GABA receptor-gated chloride conductance.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that alterations of GABAergic neurotransmission are implicated in the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Increased concentrations of endogenous benzodiazepines with positive allosteric modulatory properties at the GABA-A receptor complex were proposed as a pathophysiological mechanism to explain increased GABAergic tone in HE. However, results of controlled trials with benzodiazepine receptor antagonists have yielded equivocal results and increases in benzodiazepine levels in body fluids of cirrhotic patients were suggested to be largely accounted for by previous pharmaceutical benzodiazepine intake. In the present study the issue of benzodiazepine receptor ligands in brains of cirrhotic patients, and their contribution to alterations of GABA-A receptor complex in HE are addressed. "Benzodiazepine-like" ligands were present in trace amounts in autopsied brain tissue from control subjects (0.2 +/- 0.2 ng/g tissue), and from cirrhotic patients not previously exposed to benzodiazepine medication (0.8 +/- 0.4 ng/g tissue). In contrast, these ligands accumulate in brain extracts from cirrhotic patients previously exposed to benzodiazepines by up to 200-fold (161.5 +/- 93.2 DE ng/g tissue). Brain extracts from cirrhotic patients increased the binding of the GABA-A receptor agonist [3H]muscimol. This increase was minimal with brain extracts from controls (6.8 +/- 2.8{\%}), but was significant with brain extracts from cirrhotic patients without (29.4 +/- 2.7{\%}), or with (55.1 +/- 7.6{\%}) previous exposure to benzodiazepines. Addition of flumazenil, a selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist did not significantly modify the increase of [3H]muscimol binding by brain extracts from patients without prior exposure to benzodiazepines and only partially inhibited the increase of [3H]muscimol binding in presence of brain extracts from cirrhotic patients previously exposed to benzodiazepines. These findings suggest the presence of nonbenzodiazepine substances (possibly neurosteroids) with positive allosteric modulatory properties at the GABA-A receptor complex in brain in hepatic encephalopathy.},

abstract = {Management of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) primarily involves avoidance of precipitating factors and administration of various ammonia-lowering therapies such as nonabsorbable disaccharides and antimicrobial agents like rifaximin. The nonabsorbable disaccharides which include lactulose and lactitol are considered the first-line therapy for the treatment of HE and minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). Lactulose significantly improves cognitive function and health-related quality of life in patients with MHE. Lactitol is comparable to lactulose in the treatment of HE with fewer side effects. Lactulose has also shown to be effective in primary and secondary prophylaxis of HE. Disaccharides were found to be comparable to rifaximin in recent systemic reviews in the treatment of HE however conclusion was based on inclusion of some poor quality trials. Combination therapy of disaccharides either with rifaximin, L-ornithine L-aspartate,probiotics for the treatment of HE needs further validation in large studies.},

abstract = {Aberrant brain functional connectivity has been considered as the important mechanism underlying minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE); however, little is known about the change in interhemispheric connection in MHE patients. Twenty patients with HBV-related cirrhosis and MHE and 15 healthy controls were included in this study and underwent the resting-state fMRI scanning and diffusion tensor imaging. The functional connectivity between symmetric interhemispheric voxels was computed by a technique called voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), in which the time series for each voxel in one hemisphere was correlated with that of its homotopic voxel. Diffusion tensor imaging was conducted to measure the mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values in corpus callosum (CC). Compared with controls, MHE patients showed decreased regional VMHC in medial frontal gyrus, superior frontal gryus, anterior cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, postcentral gyrus, lingual gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus. MHE patients had significant decreased FA value in CC genu and CC splenium and increased MD value in CC genu. Pearson correlation analyses showed that the VMHC in anterior cingulate gyrus/medial frontal gyrus was correlated with FA/MD values of CC genu. These findings may suggest aberrant interhemispheric coordination in MHE and may provide new insight into the disease-related mechanisms.},

abstract = {Positron-emission tomography (PET) is a quantitative technique that produces images of biological or physiological processes. The nature of the image depends on the tracer used: common tracers used to study HE include 18F-fluordeoxyglucose, a marker of glucose metabolism; 15O-water, a marker of cerebral blood flow; and 13N-ammonia, a marker of ammonia metabolism. Combined blood flow and ammonia metabolism studies can be used to calculate the permeability surface area product for ammonia at the blood brain barrier. To take full advantage of PET, the data should be analyzed using one of the several sophisticated image processing and analysis techniques that are available. Thus, PET is an ideal technique to evaluate ammonia metabolism and, because of a close linkage of blood flow and glucose metabolism with neural activity, to investigate the neural response to drugs and other treatments and to examine neural systems that mediate specific tasks that are impaired in patients with HE.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of hepatic cirrhosis. The clinical diagnosis is based on two concurrent types of symptoms: impaired mental status and impaired neuromotor function. Impaired mental status is characterized by deterioration in mental status with psychomotor dysfunction, impaired memory, and increased reaction time, sensory abnormalities, poor concentration, disorientation and coma. Impaired neuromotor function include hyperreflexia, rigidity, myoclonus and asterixis. The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy has not been clearly defined. The general consensus is that elevated levels of ammonia and an inflammatory response work in synergy to cause astrocyte to swell and fluid to accumulate in the brain which is thought to explain the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. Acetyl-L-carnitine, the short-chain ester of carnitine is endogenously produced within mitochondria and peroxisomes and is involved in the transport of acetyl-moieties across the membranes of these organelles. Acetyl-L-carnitine administration has shown the recovery of neuropsychological activities related to attention/concentration, visual scanning and tracking, psychomotor speed and mental flexibility, language short-term memory, attention, and computing ability. In fact, Acetyl-L-carnitine induces ureagenesis leading to decreased blood and brain ammonia levels. Acetyl-L-carnitine treatment decreases the severity of mental and physical fatigue, depression cognitive impairment and improves health-related quality of life. The aim of this review was to provide an explanation on the possible toxic effects of ammonia in HE and evaluate the potential clinical benefits of ALC.},

We therefore presented a battery of attention tests in addition to the PSE-Test to a group of cirrhotics without clinical signs of HE compared to a healthy control group matched for age and education to determine whether the addition of special attention tests would increase the diagnostic sensitivity of the PSE-Test. It was shown that the patients with a pathological PSE-Test result differed significantly from controls in all attention tests applied, while the patients with normal PSE-Test results achieved attention test results similar to that of the controls. Thus, the PSE-Test results represent attention deficits as well as deficits in motor skills, visuo-spatial orientation, and visual construction.},

There is an enormous amount of textual data available in machine readable format which can be easily accessed via the Internet or databases. This ranges from scientific articles, abstracts and books to memos, letters, online forums, mailing lists, blogs, and other communication media delivering sensible information. Text mining is a highly interdisciplinary research field utilizing techniques from computer science, linguistics, and statistics. For the latter R is one of the leading computing environments offering a broad range of statistical methods. However, until recently, R has lacked an explicit framework for text mining purposes. This has changed with the tm (Feinerer, 2008; Feinerer et al., 2008) package which provides a text mining infrastructure for R. This allows R users to work efficiently with texts and corresponding meta data and transform the texts into structured representations where existing R methods can be applied, e.g., for clustering or classification. In this article we will give a short overview of the tm package. Then we will present two exemplary text mining applications, one in the field of stylometry and authorship attribution, the second is an analysis of a mailing list. Our aim is to show that tm provides the necessary abstraction over the actual text management so that the reader can use his own texts for a wide variety of text mining techniques.},

abstract = {The importance of measurements of the blood ammonia concentration in the evaluation of patients with known or suspected hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is still disputed in spite of a general acknowledgment that ammonia is important in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Several recent studies have suggested that it is not necessary to utilize arterial blood when measuring ammonia in the blood. Venous blood or a computation of the partial pressure of ammonia gas in blood samples may suffice. The value of blood ammonia measurements is limited by the fact that this is not the variable that is the most important. Ideally, one would like to know how much ammonia enters the brain, not how much is in the blood. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the critical and poorly understood element in this relationship. Although both ammonia in the gas and ionic forms cross the BBB, the ease with which this movement occurs is significantly higher in patients with HE. In the absence of simple methods to measure the brain ammonia metabolic rate and to assess the BBB to ammonia in conjunction with measuring the blood ammonia concentration, the variables that would be the most desirable to measure, the use of arterial and/or venous blood measurements needs to be coupled with a complete understanding of the physiology of cerebral ammonia metabolism.},

Therefore we investigated the effects of intravenous injection of F and S in dogs with chronic HE 8 to 12 weeks after placement of a portocaval shunt and 40{\%} hepatectomy (n=7), compared to sham-operated pair-fed controls (n=7). The HE dogs had hyperammonemia (298 +/- 48 microM v 33 +/- 3 before surgery (mean +/- SEM)) and signs of HE at the start of the experiments (0.9 +/- 0.1 (scale 0-4)). Three (S3) and 8 (S8) mg/kg of S resulted in a significant improvement of encephalopathy (grade 0.9 +/- 0.2 immediately before v 0.5 +/- 0.1 after injection (S3) and 0.7 +/- 0.1 v 0.3 +/- 0.1 (S8)) and increase in mean dominant frequency of the EEG (MDF; 9.1 +/- 0.7 Hz v 11.1 +/- 0.3 (S3) and 8.9 +/- 0.5 v 11.0 +/- 0.3 (S8)) in HE dogs, whereas 15 mg/kg of S, 3 and 8 mg/kg of F, and the vehicle had no significant effects. The efficacy of S in these dogs is consistent with an increased GABAergic tone in the pathogenesis of chronic HE.

Prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics may exhibit efficacy in the treatment of HE by modulating the gut flora. They improve derangement in flora by decreasing the counts of pathogenic bacteria and thus improving the endotoxemia, HE and the liver disease. Current evidence suggest that the trials evaluating the role of probiotics in the treatment of HE are of not high quality and all trials had high risk of bias and high risk of random errors. Therefore, the use of probiotics for patients with HE cannot be currently recommended. Further RCTs are required.

abstract = {Results of neuropathologic, spectroscopic, and neurochemical studies continue to  confirm a major role for ammonia in the pathogenesis of the central nervous system complications of both acute and chronic liver failure. Damage to astrocytes characterized by cell swelling (acute liver failure) or Alzheimer Type II astrocytosis (chronic liver failure) can be readily reproduced by acute or chronic exposure of these cells in vitro to pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of ammonia. Furthermore, exposure of the brain or cultured astrocytes to ammonia results in similar alterations in expression of genes coding for key astrocytic proteins. Such proteins include the structural glial fibrillary acidic protein, glutamate transporters, and peripheral-type (mitochondrial) benzodiazepine receptors. Brain-blood ammonia concentration ratios (normally of the order of 2) are increased up to fourfold in liver failure and arterial blood ammonia concentrations are good predictors of cerebral herniation in patients with acute liver failure. Studies using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients with chronic liver failure reveal a positive correlation between the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms and brain concentrations of the brain ammonia-detoxification product glutamine. Increased intracellular glutamine may be a contributory cause of brain edema in hyperammonemia. Positron emission tomography studies using 13HN3 provide evidence of increased blood-brain ammonia transfer and brain ammonia utilization rates in patients with chronic liver failure. In addition to the use of nonabsorbable disaccharides and antibiotics to reduce gut ammonia production, new approaches to the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy by lowering of brain ammonia include the use of L-ornithine-L-aspartate and mild hypothermia.},

Sixty-five volunteers (32 patients with cirrhosis and 33 healthy volunteers) were assessed by means of the Inhibitory Control Task (ICT). A Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) was fitted for jointly modeling the mean and the intra-variability of Reaction Times (RTs) as a function of socio-demographic and task related covariates. Furthermore, a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) was fitted for modeling accuracy. When controlling for the covariates, patients without minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) did not differ from patients with MHE in the low-demanding condition, both in terms of RTs and accuracy. Moreover, they showed a significant decline in accuracy compared to the control group. Compared to patients with MHE, patients without MHE showed faster RTs and higher accuracy only in the high-demanding condition. The results revealed that the application of GAMLSS and GLMM models are able to capture subtle cognitive alterations, previously not detected, in patients' subclinical pathologies.},

These studies and a similar previous one with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) suggest that the inhibitory neuromodulators do not have a prominent role in the pathogenesis of hepatic coma.},

@book{Iacus2008,
abstract = {This book is very different from any other publication in the field and it is unique because of its focus on the practical implementation of the simulation and estimation methods presented. The book should be useful to practitioners and students with minimal mathematical background, but because of the many R programs, probably also to many mathematically well educated practitioners. Many of the methods presented in the book have, so far, not been used much in practice because the lack of an implementation in a unified framework. This book fills the gap. With the R code included in this book, a lot of useful methods become easy to use for practitioners and students. An R package called `sde' provides functionswith easy interfaces ready to be used on empirical data from real life applications. Although it contains a wide range of results, the book has an introductory character and necessarily does not cover the whole spectrum of simulation and inference for general stochastic differential equations. The book is organized in four chapters. The first one introduces the subject and presents several classes of processes used in many fields of mathematics, computational biology, finance and the social sciences. The second chapter is devoted to simulation schemes and covers new methods not available in other milestones publication known so far. The third one is focused on parametric estimation techniques. In particular, it includes exact likelihood inference, approximated and pseudo-likelihood methods, estimating functions, generalized method of moments and other techniques. The last chapter contains miscellaneous topics like nonparametric estimation, model identification and change point estimation. The reader non-expert in R language, will find a concise introduction to this environment focused on the subject of the book which should allow for instant use of the proposed material. To each R functions presented in the book a documentation page is available at the end of the book.},

abstract = {Regional variations in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were assessed in 26 patients and 14 healthy volunteers using a two dimensional chemical shift imaging technique. Patients were classified as being neuropsychiatrically unimpaired, or as having subclinical or overt chronic hepatic encephalopathy (CHE). Peak area ratios of choline (Cho), glutamine and glutamate (Glx) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) relative to creatine (Cr) were measured. Significant reductions in mean Cho/Cr and elevations in mean Glx/Cr were observed in the patient population, which correlated with the severity of CHE. There were significant regional variations in these metabolite ratios with the mean Cho/Cr lowest in the occipital cortex and the mean Glx/Cr highest in the basal ganglia. NAA/Cr remained relatively constant in all areas of the brain analysed. The regional variation in the metabolite ratios suggests that spectral information from more than one voxel may be useful in the assessment of patients with CHE.},

abstract = {The NMDA type of glutamate receptors modulates learning and memory. Excessive activation of NMDA receptors leads to neuronal degeneration and death. Hyperammonemia and liver failure alter the function of NMDA receptors and of some associated signal transduction pathways. The alterations are different in acute and chronic hyperammonemia and liver failure. Acute intoxication with large doses of ammonia (and probably acute liver failure) leads to excessive NMDA receptors activation, which is responsible for ammonia-induced death. In contrast, chronic hyperammonemia induces adaptive responses resulting in impairment of signal transduction associated to NMDA receptors. The function of the glutamate-nitric oxide-cGMP pathway is impaired in brain in vivo in animal models of chronic liver failure or hyperammonemia and in homogenates from brains of patients died in hepatic encephalopathy. The impairment of this pathway leads to reduced cGMP and contributes to impaired cognitive function in hepatic encephalopathy. Learning ability is reduced in animal models of chronic liver failure and hyperammonemia and is restored by pharmacological manipulation of brain cGMP by administering phosphodiesterase inhibitors (zaprinast or sildenafil) or cGMP itself. NMDA receptors are therefore involved both in death induced by acute ammonia toxicity (and likely by acute liver failure) and in cognitive impairment in hepatic encephalopathy.},

@article{Malaguarnera2013,
abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication of hepatic cirrhosis. The clinical diagnosis is based on two concurrent types of symptoms: impaired mental status and impaired neuromotor function. Impaired mental status is characterized by deterioration in mental status with psychomotor dysfunction, impaired memory, and increased reaction time, sensory abnormalities, poor concentration, disorientation and coma. Impaired neuromotor function include hyperreflexia, rigidity, myoclonus and asterixis. The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy has not been clearly defined. The general consensus is that elevated levels of ammonia and an inflammatory response work in synergy to cause astrocyte to swell and fluid to accumulate in the brain which is thought to explain the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. Acetyl-L-carnitine, the short-chain ester of carnitine is endogenously produced within mitochondria and peroxisomes and is involved in the transport of acetyl-moieties across the membranes of these organelles. Acetyl-L-carnitine administration has shown the recovery of neuropsychological activities related to attention/concentration, visual scanning and tracking, psychomotor speed and mental flexibility, language short-term memory, attention, and computing ability. In fact, Acetyl-L-carnitine induces ureagenesis leading to decreased blood and brain ammonia levels. Acetyl-L-carnitine treatment decreases the severity of mental and physical fatigue, depression cognitive impairment and improves health-related quality of life. The aim of this review was to provide an explanation on the possible toxic effects of ammonia in HE and evaluate the potential clinical benefits of ALC.},

abstract = {The relationship between hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and the sleep-wake disturbances exhibited by patients with cirrhosis remains debated. The aim of this study was to examine the usefulness of sleep-wake interview within the context of HE assessment. One-hundred-and-six cirrhotic patients were asked three yes/no questions investigating the presence of difficulty falling asleep, night awakenings and daytime sleepiness. All underwent formal HE assessment, quantitative electroencephalography and standardised psychometry. Fifty-eight were monitored for 8 +/- 6 months in relation to the occurrence of HE. Patients complaining of daytime sleepiness (n = 75, 71 {\%}) had slower EEGs than those who did not report it (relative alpha power: 37 +/- 19 vs. 48 +/- 17 {\%}, p < 0.05). In addition, daytime sleepiness was associated with the presence of portal-systemic shunt (79 vs. 57 {\%}, p < 0.05) and HE history (72 vs. 45 {\%}, p < 0.05). Finally, the absence of excessive daytime sleepiness had a Negative Predictive Value of 92 {\%} (64-100) in relation to the development of HE during the follow-up period. These data support the appropriateness of adding a yes/no question on the presence of excessive daytime sleepiness to routine assessment of patients with cirrhosis, to help identify those who do not need further, formal HE screening.},

The model of hyperammonemia is useful to study the effect of ammonia as a brain toxic substance, but also lacks liver failure. Bile-duct ligation has been used to induce cirrhosis and could also be a model of HE, probably with the addition of a precipitant factor. An ideal model of HE in chronic liver disease must have liver cirrhosis and a precipitant factor of HE; it must also show neuropathological characteristic findings of HE, neurochemical alterations in the main pathways impaired in these complications of cirrhosis, and low-grade brain edema.},

abstract = {Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is intermittently present in up to 2/3 of patients with chronic liver disease. It impairs their daily living and can be treated. However, there is no consensus on diagnostic criteria except that psychometric methods are required. We compared two easy-to-perform reproducible bedside methods: the critical flicker frequency (CFF) and continuous reaction times (CRT) tests. A CFF <39 Hz and CRT-index <1.9 (index: the ratio 50/(90 minus 10) percentiles of reaction times) indicates cerebral dysfunction. 154 patients with acute or chronic liver disease with out overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) underwent both tests at the same occasion. Both tests were abnormal in 20{\%} of the patients and both tests were normal in 40{\%} of the patients. In more than 1/3 the two tests were not in agreement as CFF classified 32{\%} and CRT-index classified 48{\%} of the patients as having MHE (p < 0.005). The two tests were weakly linearly correlated (r(2) = 0.14, p < 0.001) and neither test correlated with the metabolic liver function measured by the Galactose Elimination Capacity (GEC), nor with the blood ammonia concentration. Both tests identified a large fraction of the patients as having MHE and cleared only 40{\%}. The two tests did not show concordant results, likely because they describe different aspects of MHE: the CFF gives a measure of astrocytic metabolic state and hence pathogenic aspects of MHE, whereas the CRT measures a composite key performance, viz. the ability of reacting appropriately to a sensory stimulus. The choice of test depends on the information needed in the clinical and scientific care and study of the patients.},

abstract = {1H magnetic resonance (1H MR) studies of the brain in patients with liver diseases have shown several abnormalities that may be relevant for the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. 1H magnetic resonance imaging shows a typical pallidal hyperintensity on T1-weighted images. This abnormality appears to be secondary to the accumulation of manganese in basal ganglia because of portal-systemic shunting. No direct correlation between the magnitude of pallidal hyperintensity and the grade of hepatic encephalopathy has been found, but some studies have related pallidal hyperintensity to parkinsonism. 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows relative to creatine an increase in glutamine/glutamate (Glx) signal and a decrease of choline containing compounds (Cho) and myo-inositol. Abnormalities in the Glx signal have been interpreted as an increase in brain glutamine secondary to the metabolism of ammonia in astrocytes. Disturbances of Cho and myo-inositol have been interpreted as a compensatory response to the increase in intracellular osmolality caused by the accumulation of glutamine in astrocytes. In addition, magnetization transfer imaging shows signs compatible with low-grade cerebral edema. Altogether, 1H MR studies suggest the accumulation of manganese and the development of osmotic abnormalities in the brain of patients with cirrhosis. These abnormalities appear to participate in some of the neurological manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy.},

The method has been in clinical use for decades in Denmark for the stated purpose. The method is a 10-minutes, computerised registration of a series of motor reaction times to an auditory stimulus, with results reported as the CRTindex (50 percentile/(90-10) percentile) as a parameter of reaction time variability. The index is a measure of alertness stability and is used to assess attention and cognition deficits. The CRTindex identifies half of patients in a Danish cohort with chronic liver disease, as having m/cHE, a normal value safely precludes HE, it has a broad outcome span reflecting the degree of brain impairment, it shows no learning effect, and it is independent on age and gender. The CRTindex is, therefore, a candidate tool for routine screening, detecting, grading, and monitoring m/cHE. Still, however, further methodological and clinical validation trials are required and are currently being conducted.},

When the function to be optimized (for example, a log-likelihood) is nonlinear in the model's parameters, the function will generally not be globally concave and may have irregularities such as saddlepoints or discontinuities. Optimization methods that rely on derivatives of the objective function may be unable to find any optimum at all. Multiple local optima may exist, so that there is no guarantee that a derivative-based method will converge to the global optimum. On the other hand, algorithms that do not use derivative information (such as pure genetic algorithms) are for many problems needlessly poor at local hill climbing. Most statistical problems are regular in a neighborhood of the solution. Therefore, for some portion of the search space, derivative information is useful. The function supports parallel processing on multiple CPUs on a single machine or a cluster of computers.},

Visual attention orienting was evaluated by a computerized neuropsychological test. The Reitan A test, commonly used to detect subclinical hepatic encephalopathy, was used to evaluate mental performance. Psychometric test scores were reduced in cirrhotics compared to controls (attention test: neutral condition = 495 +/- 149 vs. 401 +/- 98 msec; valid condition = 434 +/- 110 vs. 398 +/- 84 msec; invalid condition = 485 +/- 146 vs. 392 +/- 110 msec; p < 0.001; Reitan A test = 52 +/- 20 vs. 35 +/- 11 sec., p < 0.001). The attention effect of the cue was found both in controls and cirrhotics; however, it was significantly higher in cirrhotics than in controls (61 +/- 111 vs. 33 +/- 41 msec; p < 0.002). The attention effect was directly correlated with Reitan A test (r = 0.23, p = 0.05) in cirrhotics. In conclusion, in cirrhotic patients without overt hepatic encephalopathy, visual attention orienting was present and focusing to an indexed location had a higher effect on reaction time compared to controls, possibly because of reduced basal arousal.},

Furthermore, it has been suggested that catabolism of the branched-chain amino acid isoleucine may help curb the effect of hyperammonemia by by-passing the TCA cycle block as well as providing the carbon skeleton for glutamate and glutamine synthesis thus fixating ammonia. Here we present novel results describing [U-(13)C]isoleucine metabolism in muscle and brain analyzed by mass spectrometry in bile duct ligated rats, a model of chronic hepatic encephalopathy, and discuss them in relation to previously published results from neural cell cultures. The metabolism of [U-(13)C]isoleucine in muscle tissue was about five times higher than that in the brain which, in turn, was lower than in corresponding cell cultures. However, synthesis of glutamate and glutamine was supported by catabolism of isoleucine. In rat brain, differential labeling patterns in glutamate and glutamine suggest that isoleucine may primarily be metabolized in the astrocytic compartment which is in accordance with previous findings in neural cell cultures. Lastly, in rat brain the labeling patterns of glutamate, aspartate and GABA do not suggest any significant inhibition by ammonia of TCA cycle activity which corresponds well to findings in neural cell cultures. Branched-chain amino acids including isoleucine are used for treating hepatic encephalopathy and the present findings shed light on the possible mechanism involved. The low turn-over of isoleucine in rat brain suggests that this amino acid does not serve the role of providing metabolites pertinent to TCA cycle function and hence energy formation as well as the necessary carbon skeleton for subsequent ammonia fixation in hyperammonemia. The higher metabolism of isoleucine in muscle could, however, contribute to ammonia fixation and thus likely be of value in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is normally diagnosed by neuropsychological (NP) tests. The goals of this study were to quantify cerebral metabolites, separate glutamate (Glu) from glutamine (Gln) in patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) as well as healthy subjects using the prior-knowledge fitting (ProFit) algorithm on data acquired by two-dimensional (2D) localized correlated spectroscopy (L-COSY) on two different MR scanners, and to correlate the metabolite changes with neuropsychological (NP) tests. We studied 14 MHE patients and 18 healthy controls using a GE 1.5 T Signa MR scanner. Another group of 16 MHE patients and 18 healthy controls were studied using a Siemens 1.5 T Avanto MR scanner. The following parameters were used for L-COSY: TR/TE = 2 s/30 ms, 3 x 3 x 3 cm(3) voxel size, 96 Deltat(1) increments with 8 averages per Deltat(1). Using the ProFit algorithm, we were able to differentiate Gln from Glu on the GE 1.5 T data in the medial frontal white/gray matter. The ratios of myo-inositol (mI), Glu, total choline, scyllo-inositol (sI), phosphoethanolamine (PE), and total N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) showed statistically significant decline in HE patients compared to healthy controls, while the ratio of Gln was significantly increased. Similar trend was seen in the ProFit quantified Siemens 1.5 T data in the frontal and occipito-parietal white/gray regions. Among the NP domain scores, motor function, cognitive speed, executive function and the global scores showed significant differences. Excellent correlations between various NP domains and metabolite ratios were also observed. ProFit based cerebral metabolite quantitation enhances the understanding and basis of the current hypothesis of MHE.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of chronic alcoholism and patients show neurological symptoms ranging from mild cognitive dysfunction to coma and death. The HE brain is characterized by glial changes, including microglial activation, but the exact pathogenesis of HE is poorly understood. During a study investigating cell proliferation in the subventricular zone of chronic alcoholics, a single case with widespread proliferation throughout their adjacent grey and white matter was noted. This case also had concomitant HE raising the possibility that glial proliferation might be a pathological feature of the disease. In order to explore this possibility fixed postmortem human brain tissue from chronic alcoholics with cirrhosis and HE (n = 9), alcoholics without HE (n = 4) and controls (n = 4) were examined using immunohistochemistry and cytokine assays. In total, 4/9 HE cases had PCNA- and a second proliferative marker, Ki-67-positive cells throughout their brain and these cells co-stained with the microglial marker, Iba1. These cases were termed 'proliferative HE' (pHE). The microglia in pHEs displayed an activated morphology with hypertrophied cell bodies and short, thickened processes. In contrast, the microglia in white matter regions of the non-proliferative HE cases were less activated and appeared dystrophic. pHEs were also characterized by higher interleukin-6 levels and a slightly higher neuronal density . These findings suggest that microglial proliferation may form part of an early neuroprotective response in HE that ultimately fails to halt the course of the disease because underlying etiological factors such as high cerebral ammonia and systemic inflammation remain.},

Blood ammonia is a valid over-all biomarker of HE and thus is regularly determined in clinical trials. The neurometabolites affected in HE can be assessed in vivo by proton magnetic spectroscopy. The aim of this study was to show the effect of the ammonia lowering drug L-ornithine-L-aspartate (OA) on the cerebral glutamate+glutamine/creatine (Glu+GLN/Cr) ratio. In an open clinical trial (pilot study), 15 patients with stable HE were treated with an infusion of 40 g OA over 8 h (5 g/h). Immediately before and 6-8 (mean 6.8) h after start of the infusion, spectroscopy of the parietal white matter was performed and arterial blood ammonia quantified. Glu+GLN/Cr-ratios correlated significantly with ammonia data (Spearman's correlation coefficient rs = 0.72, p < 0.001). Likewise, the OA induced changes (versus baseline before infusion) in blood ammonia level and in Glu+GLN/Cr-ratios correlated significantly rs = 0.54, p = 0.0375). Magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy assesses the neurometabolite variation present in HE. OA induced changes in cerebral Glu+GLN/ Cr-ratio were significantly correlated with the drug effects on arterial blood ammonia. These pilot data indicate that MR spectroscopy detects a specific biomarker of HE that may reflect the extent of the cerebral alterations associated with the disease.},

Effects on incidence of hepatic encephalopathy episodes in individual study and pooled databases were determined with analyses adjusted for hyponatraemia and previous episodes of encephalopathy. Hyponatraemia was improved by satavaptan. Three hundred and ninety-five hepatic encephalopathy episodes were recorded. The risk of an episode and the mean number of episodes were not reduced by satavaptan in any of the three studies in the overall population or in patients who were hyponatraemic on entry. These findings were confirmed in analysis of the pooled data. Satavaptan did not reduce the frequency of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.},

abstract = {The attention system in patients with liver cirrhosis has not yet been fully investigated. We therefore studied visual attention orienting in cirrhotic patients without overt hepatic encephalopathy. Seventy cirrhotic patients without overt hepatic encephalopathy (aged 57 +/- 10 yr., mean +/- s.d.) and 55 controls (aged 49 +/- 12 yr.) were enrolled. Visual attention orienting was evaluated by a computerized neuropsychological test. The Reitan A test, commonly used to detect subclinical hepatic encephalopathy, was used to evaluate mental performance. Psychometric test scores were reduced in cirrhotics compared to controls (attention test: neutral condition = 495 +/- 149 vs. 401 +/- 98 msec; valid condition = 434 +/- 110 vs. 398 +/- 84 msec; invalid condition = 485 +/- 146 vs. 392 +/- 110 msec; p < 0.001; Reitan A test = 52 +/- 20 vs. 35 +/- 11 sec., p < 0.001). The attention effect of the cue was found both in controls and cirrhotics; however, it was significantly higher in cirrhotics than in controls (61 +/- 111 vs. 33 +/- 41 msec; p < 0.002). The attention effect was directly correlated with Reitan A test (r = 0.23, p = 0.05) in cirrhotics. In conclusion, in cirrhotic patients without overt hepatic encephalopathy, visual attention orienting was present and focusing to an indexed location had a higher effect on reaction time compared to controls, possibly because of reduced basal arousal.},

abstract = {Minimal hepatic encephalopathy is a syndrome caused by liver cirrhosis and accompanied by a broad spectrum of cognitive symptoms. The objective of the present study was to describe the prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients and to compare their cognitive performance with controls using standardized tests. Patients receiving medication or experiencing comorbidities associated with cognitive disorders were excluded. The final cohort was compared with a control-matched group using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), as well as Simple Drawing, Clock Drawing, Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Random Letter, Stroop, Trail-Making Test (TMT) A and B, Boston Naming, Category Verbal Fluency, Digit Span, Constructional Praxis, Processing Speed, and Similarities Tests. The results indicated no differences in the prevalence of cognitive complaints spontaneously reported by 29 patients with cirrhosis versus 22 healthy controls. The most affected tests included: MMSE (26.3 +/- 2 vs. 28.1 +/- 1.8 points; p = 0.004), learning (35.4 +/- 9 vs. 41 +/- 9.1 points; p = 0.041), retroactive interference (0.67 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.84 +/- 0.16 points; p = 0.004), and recognition (8.7 +/- 2.6 vs. 11.2 +/- 4.1 points; p = 0.024) in RAVLT, TMT-A (63.2 +/- 29.3 vs. 47.6 +/- 16.5 s; p = 0.029) and TMT-B (197.9 +/- 88.1 vs. 146.8 +/- 76.5 s; p = 0.03). No differences were observed with respect to age, gender, and education. In conclusion, MMSE proved to be a useful tool for detecting global cognitive impairment experienced by cirrhosis patients. Moreover, the most impaired cognitive functions were verbal episodic memory and information processing speed. These findings suggest that minimal hepatic encephalopathy represents a disorder that affects the medial temporal system and, possibly, the prefrontal cortex, and this requires further study.},

Whether the "residual effects" of HE, degenerative brain injury or independent neurological insults are causing post transplant neurological deficits is not easy to discern. As more emphasis is being put on maintaining brain 'status' after liver transplantation, we are finding confirmation of the largely reversible nature of HE.

abstract = {The term minimal hepatic encephalopathy refers to the subtle changes in cognitive function, electrophysiological parameters, cerebral neurochemical/neurotransmitter homeostasis, cerebral blood flow, metabolism, and fluid homeostasis that can be observed in patients with cirrhosis who have no clinical evidence of hepatic encephalopathy. Use of this term emphasizes the fact that the entity of hepatic encephalopathy is a single syndrome with quantitatively distinct features relating to severity. The absence of clinical evidence of hepatic encephalopathy is key to the diagnosis and can only be determined by a detailed assessment of the patients' history and a comprehensive neurological assessment of consciousness, cognitive, and motor function. The neuropsychological features of minimal hepatic encephalopathy point to a disorder of executive functioning, particularly selective attention and psychomotor speed, but other abnormalities may be observed. Alterations in electrophysiological variables have been described; endogenous evoked potentials are, in principle, more likely to reflect the presence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy, since they reflect cognitive phenomena rather than mere stimulus conduction but the specificity of the changes observed is unclear at present. Changes have also been described in the execution of diadochokinetic movements and in the capacity to discriminate flickering light, both of which may have diagnostic potential. The changes observed in cerebral blood flow and metabolism in SPET, PET, and 1H and 31P MRS studies reflect the pathogenic process that underlies the condition rather than providing diagnostic information. Similarly, the morphological brain abnormalities identified in this population, including mild brain oedema, hyperintensity of the globus pallidus and other subcortical nuclei observed in cerebral MR studies, and the central and cortical atrophy observed in neural imaging studies, are unlikely to have diagnostic utility. The presence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy is not without clinical consequence; it has a detrimental effect on health-related quality of life, the ability to perform complex tasks such as driving, and on outcome.},

We studied the association between saccadic latency, liver function and paper- and pencil tests in 70 patients with cirrhosis and 31 patients after liver transplantation. The tests included the porto-systemic encephalopathy (PSE-) test, critical flicker frequency, MELD score and ammonia concentration. A normal range for saccades was established in 31 control subjects. Clinical and biochemical parameters of liver, blood, and kidney function were also determined. Median saccadic latencies were significantly longer in patients with liver cirrhosis when compared to patients after liver transplantation (244 ms vs. 278 ms p < 0.001). Both patient groups had prolonged saccadic latency when compared to an age matched control group (175 ms). The reciprocal of median saccadic latency (mu) correlated with PSE tests, MELD score and critical flicker frequency. A significant correlation between the saccadic latency parameter early slope (sigma(E)) that represents the prevalence of early saccades and partial pressure of ammonia was also noted. Psychometric test performance, but not saccadic latency, correlated with blood urea and sodium concentrations. Saccadic latency represents an objective and quantitative parameter of hepatic encephalopathy. Unlike psychometric test performance, these ocular responses were unaffected by renal function and can be obtained clinically within a matter of minutes by non-trained personnel.},

abstract = {There appears to be a consensus that hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a metabolic encephalopathy with a multifactorial pathogenesis. One of the factors considered to be important in the pathogenesis of HE is ammonia. However, the mechanisms by which ammonia contributes to the manifestations of HE remain poorly defined. Ammonia could be more definitively implicated in the pathogenesis of HE if its effects can be shown to lead to an enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission. In this context the effects of ammonia on the GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) neurotransmitter system may be relevant. Ammonia, at the modestly increased concentrations that commonly occur in precoma HE (0.15 mM-0.75 mM), has been shown to increase GABA-induced chloride current in cultured neurons, probably by modifying the affinity of the GABA(A) receptor for GABA. Comparable ammonia concentrations also enhanced synergistically the binding of a GABA agonist and a benzodiazepine (BZ) agonist to the GABA(A) receptor complex, phenomena which would enhance the neuroinhibitory effects of these ligands. Also, GABA increased the potency of ammonia-induced enhancement of the binding of a BZ agonist to the GABA(A) receptor complex, and brain levels of BZ agonists are elevated in liver failure. In addition, ammonia has been shown to inhibit astrocytic uptake of GABA by 30{\%}-50{\%}, an effect which would increase the synaptic availability of GABA at GABA(A) receptors. Furthermore, increased ammonia concentrations upregulate the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor in the outer membrane of astroglial mitochondria, thereby enhancing astrocytic mitochondrial synthesis and release of neurosteroids. Some neurosteroids, for example tetrahydroprogesterone (THP) and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC), are potent agonists of the GABA(A) receptor complex, on which there are specific binding sites for neurosteroids, that are distinct from those for BZs and barbiturates. Tetrahydroprogesterone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone levels were found to be increased in a mouse model of acute liver failure, and, when THP or THDOC was injected into normal mice, sedation and Alzheimer type II astrocytic changes in the cortex, striatum, and hypothalmus were induced. Each of these direct or indirect effects of ammonia on the GABA neurotransmitter system has the potential of increasing inhibitory neurotransmission, and, hence, contributing to the manifestations of HE.},

abstract = {To detect possible changes in the regulation of glutamate/gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) enzymes at the level of gene expression in a thioacetamide-induced rat model of acute hepatic encephalopathy, we have examined changes in the mRNAs of four glutamate/GABA enzymes by quantitative RNA blot hybridization analysis. Such changes could reflect cell adaptation to excess ammonia or some other associated metabolic stress. The mRNA levels of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) decreased similarly in three different brain regions, whereas those of glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutaminase (GA) increased. The mRNA levels of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) were unchanged. The results indicate that some effect of liver damage, presumably hyperammonemia, affected the expression of some, but not all, genes associated with ammonia and glutamate metabolism in the brain. This adaptation of gene expression to secondary effects of ammonia on brain amino acid neurotransmitter metabolism or brain energy metabolism could play a role in the physiological changes observed in hepatic encephalopathy.},

We aimed to determine whether treatment in chronic liver disease altered brain size. The study group comprised nine patients with cirrhosis (7 Child's grade B and 2 Child's grade C). Six had minimal and three had overt hepatic encephalopathy on clinical, psychometric, and electrophysiological testing. Cerebral MRI was performed in seven patients before and 6 weeks after starting lactulose. A further two patients underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunting with MRI performed before and 24 h afterwards. One patient had a further scan 3 months after TIPSS. Brain size was measured using a semiautomated contour/thresholding technique. Measurable changes were found after treatment intervention, but there was no correlation with severity of encephalopathy (West Haven criteria) or liver dysfunction (Child's score). Three patients improved on lactulose, the brain size decreased with an increase in ventricular volume. Two patients deteriorated; the brain size increased with a concomitant decrease in ventricular volume. Two stable patients had small changes, one with an increase in brain size and a decrease in ventricular volume and the other showing the converse. Following TIPSS, there was an increase in brain size in both patients, evident within 24 h in one patient and at 3 months in the other. Coregistered MRI demonstrates easily detectable changes in brain size following treatment intervention. Our results support the hypothesis that low-grade brain swelling is present, even in minimal hepatic encephalopathy.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy is the main cognitive dysfunction in cirrhotic patients associated with impaired prognosis. Hyperammonemia plus inflammatory response do play a crucial role on hepatic encephalopathy. However, in some patients HE appeared without hyperammonemia and patients with increased levels of ammonia could not show cognitive dysfunction. This has led to investigate other factors that could act in a synergistic way. Diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance are characterized by releasing and enhancing these pro-inflammatory cytokines and, additionally, has been related to hepatic encephalopathy. Indeed, patients with diabetes showed raised risk of over hepatic encephalopathy in comparison with non-cirrhotics. Type 2 diabetes mellitus could impair hepatic encephalopathy by different mechanisms that include: a) increasing glutaminase activity; b) impairing gut motility and promoting constipation, intestinal bacterial overgrowth and bacterial translocation. Despite of insufficient clarity about the practicability of anti-diabetic therapy and the most efficacious therapy, we would have to pay a special attention to the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance in cirrhotic patients.},

Results are collected in a scalable, distributed data store and returned to the interactive user session. We apply our approach to a forecasting application that fits a variety of models, prohibiting an analytical description of the statistical uncertainty associated with the overall forecast. To overcome this, we generate simulation-based uncertainty bands, which necessitates a large number of computationally intensive realizations. Our technique cut total run time by a factor of 300. Distributing the computation across many machines permits analysts to focus on statistical issues while answering questions that would be intractable without significant parallel computational infrastructure. We present real-world performance characteristics from our application to allow practitioners to better understand the nature of massively parallel statistical simulations in R. },

abstract = {The aetiology of minimal hepatic encephalopathy (mHE) remains unclear. It is generally accepted that hyperammonaemia plays a major role, however there are a multitude of metabolic perturbations present. To determine the contribution of hyperammonaemia to mHE symptom development, ten healthy males (Age:25 +/- 5 yrs, BM:76.3 +/- 7.1 kg, Height:178.6 +/- 4.5 cm, mean +/- SD) received two 4 h intravenous infusions of either a 2{\%} ammonium chloride solution (AMM) or a placebo (PLA;0.9{\%} sodium chloride) using a double blind cross-over design. Sensations of fatigue were measured at baseline, 2 and 4 h using the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF) questionnaire. Learning {\&} memory, motor control and cognition were assessed using Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVL), Continuous Compensatory Tracking (COMPTRACK) Task and Inhibitory Control Test (ICT) respectively. Arterialised venous blood samples were collected every hour, and analysed for ammonia concentration. There was a significantly higher plasma ammonia concentration in the AMM trial than the PLA trial at every time point during the infusion, peaking at 2 h (57 +/- 4 mumol/L PLA, 225 +/- 14 mumol/L AMM; p < 0.05). At 2 h there were significantly higher sensations of general fatigue (Z = -2.527, p = 0.008, 2 tailed) and physical fatigue (Z = -2.156, p = 0.027, 2 tailed), and lower sensations of vigour (Z = -2.456, p = 0.012, 2 tailed) for the AMM trial. There were no significant effects on the performance of the psychological tasks. These results demonstrate that hyperammonaemia in the absence of other complications induces significant sensations of fatigue but does not cause the typically observed performance impairment in individuals with mHE. Supporting the hypothesis for synergism between ammonia and other co-factors in mHE.},

For comparison, high-affinity uptake of Glu and Asp was determined in human hippocampal brain tissue obtained at autopsy from cirrhotic patients dying in hepatic coma and from control brains free from neurological, psychiatric, or hepatic diseases. Sera and CSF from patients with chronic liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) were seen to reduce dramatically Glu and Asp uptake into rat hippocampal dendritic layers. A close inverse relationship was found to exist between the level of ammonia in the sera and the inhibition of uptake, both phenomena correlating highly with the extent of liver failure. The present findings, obtained after dilution of sera from patients with HE while maintaining initial ammonium levels, elucidate, however, that ammonia alone cannot account for the reduction in Glu/Asp uptake capacity. The inhibition of Asp uptake into human hippocampal formation of patients dying in hepatic coma was even more pronounced when compared to that found in rat hippocampus incubated in sera and CSF from patients. Glu/Asp uptake into brain tissue is supposed to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of HE accompanying liver dysfunctions.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a diverse manifestation of acute and chronic liver failure, ranging from cognitive impairment, only detectable on psychometric evaluation through to confusion, coma and death from cerebral oedema. While there is widespread acceptance of its importance, there is little consensus on how best to diagnose and monitor HE. Clinical descriptions, psychometric testing, electroencephalography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (and lately, MR spectroscopy) have all been proposed. MR techniques, in contrast to other modalities, have the benefit of objectivity and of being able to interrogate the brain directly with respect to changes in brain size, function and the metabolic disturbances thought to underlie HE, particularly in the context of astrocyte swelling. Modern clinical MRI scanners with multinuclear MR spectroscopy capabilities and brain mapping software can demonstrate structural and functional cellular changes using volumetric MRI, magnetization transfer MRI, diffusion-weighting MRI, functional MRI with oxygenation measurements and in vivo and in vitro (1)H and (31)P MR spectroscopy. This review describes the relative merits of these techniques and provides guidance on the directions for future research and translation into clinical practice.},

abstract = {The importance of measurements of the blood ammonia concentration in the evaluation of patients with known or suspected hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is still disputed in spite of a general acknowledgment that ammonia is important in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Several recent studies have suggested that it is not necessary to utilize arterial blood when measuring ammonia in the blood. Venous blood or a computation of the partial pressure of ammonia gas in blood samples may suffice. The value of blood ammonia measurements is limited by the fact that this is not the variable that is the most important. Ideally, one would like to know how much ammonia enters the brain, not how much is in the blood. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the critical and poorly understood element in this relationship. Although both ammonia in the gas and ionic forms cross the BBB, the ease with which this movement occurs is significantly higher in patients with HE. In the absence of simple methods to measure the brain ammonia metabolic rate and to assess the BBB to ammonia in conjunction with measuring the blood ammonia concentration, the variables that would be the most desirable to measure, the use of arterial and/or venous blood measurements needs to be coupled with a complete understanding of the physiology of cerebral ammonia metabolism.},

The aim of this study was to investigate which cognitive functions are selectively compromised in Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) and to clarify the relationship between clinically overt or nonovert HE and the different forms and degrees of decay in cognitive deficits. Twenty-two patients without overt HE and 12 patients who showed overt HE at the first level of severity, along with matched control subjects, were compared in several cognitive domains. The results showed significant differences in some measures of attention between patients with minimal HE (mHE) and patients with overt HE. There were also notable differences in verbal short-term memory between patients with mHE and healthy subjects. Thus, we can hypothesize that there is a linear diminution in short-term memory and attentional performance starting from healthy patients, moving toward patients with mHE, and finally progressing toward patients with the first grade of overt HE. There are two types of diminution that we noted: between patients with mHE and the overt form, the decline in the attentional domain was more evident, while between healthy subjects and mHE patients, short-term memory showed a more evident decline.},

abstract = {Despite enormous strides in our understanding of human disease, the precise mechanisms of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a potential long-term complication of liver failure, are still unclear. Brain serotonin, a neurotransmitter with widespread distribution in the CNS, plays a role in the regulation of a wide range of physiological behaviors and functions. In addition, it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several pathological processes, including HE. This work reviews the relationship between brain serotonergic dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients and experimental animals. The existing changes in the synthesis, metabolism, storage, and release of neuronal serotonin in HE point to a serotonergic synaptic deficit in this condition. Given the established role of the brain serotonergic system in the regulation of sleep, circadian rhythmicity, and locomotion, selective alterations of this system could be an important part of the neurophysiological background responsible for the behavioral changes in rats with portacaval anastomosis and may contribute to the pathogenesis of HE in cirrhotic patients. The findings that serotoninergic turnover is exquisitely and selectively sensitive to the degree of porto-systemic shunting and hyperammonemia suggest a role for serotonin in early neuropsychiatric symptoms of HE. Pharmacological manipulation of the brain serotonergic system may be beneficial in the prevention and treatment of HE in cirrhotic patients.},

We studied 14 MHE patients and 18 healthy controls using a GE 1.5 T Signa MR scanner. Another group of 16 MHE patients and 18 healthy controls were studied using a Siemens 1.5 T Avanto MR scanner. The following parameters were used for L-COSY: TR/TE = 2 s/30 ms, 3 x 3 x 3 cm(3) voxel size, 96 Deltat(1) increments with 8 averages per Deltat(1). Using the ProFit algorithm, we were able to differentiate Gln from Glu on the GE 1.5 T data in the medial frontal white/gray matter. The ratios of myo-inositol (mI), Glu, total choline, scyllo-inositol (sI), phosphoethanolamine (PE), and total N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) showed statistically significant decline in HE patients compared to healthy controls, while the ratio of Gln was significantly increased. Similar trend was seen in the ProFit quantified Siemens 1.5 T data in the frontal and occipito-parietal white/gray regions. Among the NP domain scores, motor function, cognitive speed, executive function and the global scores showed significant differences. Excellent correlations between various NP domains and metabolite ratios were also observed.

However, overconfidence also leads to faulty assessments, unrealistic expectations and hazardous decisions, so it remains a puzzle how such a false belief could evolve or remain stable in a population of competing strategies that include accurate, unbiased beliefs. Here we present an evolutionary model showing that, counterintuitively, overconfidence maximizes individual fitness and populations tend to become overconfident, as long as benefits from contested resources are sufficiently large compared with the cost of competition. In contrast, unbiased strategies are only stable under limited conditions. This may help to explain why overconfidence remains prevalent today, even if it contributes to market bubbles, financial collapses, policy failures, and costly wars.},

abstract = {Plasma levels of gut-derived endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides, LPS) are often elevated in cirrhotics and are thought to contribute to hepatic encephalopathy. Circulating LPS activates macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and other potentially cytotoxic proinflammatory mediators. A pathogenic role for endotoxins is supported by studies showing that treatment with Lacto-bacillusor antibiotics, both of which reduce LPS-producing intestinal Gram-negative bacteria, alleviates experimental liver damage. To mimic the "leaky gut" syndrome with endotoxin translocation into the circulation in cirrhotics, a new animal model was developed. Rats were chronically exposed to ethanol and for the four last weeks also infused with endotoxin into the jugular vein from subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps. Animals receiving endotoxin had elevated hepatic expression of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, but compared to ethanol treatment alone hepatic steatosis and inflammatory changes were only marginally increased. This demonstrates marked endotoxin tolerance, probably as a consequence of a counteracting anti-inflammatory cytokine response. The role of gut-derived endotoxin in hepatic encephalopathy has recently received considerable attention. To further delineate the role and actions of endotoxin and its extrahepatic effects, studies applying both acute challenge and chronic infusion seem warranted. The chronic endotoxin model, mimicking the "leaky gut," may best be combined with more robust ways to impair liver function, such as carbon tetrachloride treatment, bile duct ligation, or galactosamine administration.},

Experiments with animal models of HE, and with brain slices or cultured CNS cells treated with ammonia, have documented changes in GABA distribution and transport, and modulation of the responses of both the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex and GABA(B) receptors. Although many of the data point to an enhancement of GABAergic transmission probably contributing to HE, the evidence is not unequivocal. The major weaknesses of the GABA theory are (1) in a vast majority of HE models, there were no alterations of GABA content in the brain tissue and/or extracellular space, indicating that exposure of neurons to GABA may not have been altered, (2) changes in the affinity and capacity of GABA receptor binding were either absent or qualitatively different in HE models of comparable severity and duration, and (3) no sound changes in the GABAergic system parameters were noted in clinical cases of HE. Taurine (Tau) is an amino acid that is thought to mimic GABA function because of its agonistic properties towards GABA(A) receptors, and to contribute to neuroprotection and osmoregulation. These effects require Tau redistribution between the different cell compartments and the extracellular space. Acute treatment with ammonia evokes massive release of radiolabeled or endogenous Tau from CNS tissues in vivo and in vitro, and the underlying mechanism of Tau release differs from the release evoked by depolarizing conditions or hypoosmotic treatment. Subacute or chronic HE, and also long-term treatment of cultured CNS cells in vitro with ammonia, increase spontaneous Tau "leakage" from the tissue. This is accompanied by a decreased potassium- or hypoosmolarity-induced release of Tau and often by cell swelling, indicating impaired osmoregulation. In in vivo models of HE, Tau leakage is manifested by its increased accumulation in the extrasynaptic space, which may promote inhibitory neurotransmission and/or cell membrane protection. In chronic HE in humans, decreased Tau content in CNS is thought to be one of the causes of cerebral edema. However, understanding of the impact of the changes in Tau content and transport on the pathogenic mechanisms of HE is hampered by the lack of clear-cut evidence regarding the various roles of Tau in the normal CNS.},

HE manifests as a series of neuropsychiatric and neuromuscular symptoms including personality changes, sleep abnormalities, asterixis and muscle rigidity progressing through stupor to coma. The pathophysiologic basis of HE remains unclear. There is general agreement that ammonia plays a key role. In recent years, it has been suggested that oxidative/nitrosative stress constitutes part of the pathophysiologic cascade in HE. Direct evidence for oxidative/nitrosative stress in the pathogenesis of HE has been demonstrated in experimental animal models of acute or chronic liver failure. However, evidence from studies in HE patients is limited. This review summarizes this evidence for a role of oxidative/nitrosative stress in relation to ammonia toxicity and to the pathogenesis of HE.},

The decision on the earning capability of a patient is usually based on clinical judgement, considering the patient's complaints and clinical findings such as nervousness and depression. In a comprehensive psychometric study we were able to show that cirrhotic patients, who are considered to be unable to earn their living, differ significantly from those who are working, in tests evaluating psychomotor function and in personality and subjective well-being scores representing nervousness, aggressiveness, depression. The latter scores are considered to represent the individual discrepancies between professional demands and cerebral performance. Since minimal HE affects psychomotor function but not verbal abilities this discrepancy exists predominantly in "blue collar workers." In accordance with this 60{\%} of "blue collar" (in contrast to 20{\%} of "white collar") workers of our patient group were considered unfit for work. Working ability is an essential element of quality of life in Western societies. Thus, an impairment of working capability is of major impact on quality of life in cirrhotics.},

Current approaches to long-term time series forecasting rely either on iterated predictors, direct predictors or, more recently, on the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) predictors. The iterated approach suffers from the accumulation of errors, the Direct strategy makes a conditional independence assumption, which does not necessarily preserve the stochastic properties of the time series, while the MIMO technique is limited by the reduced flexibility of the predictor. The paper compares the direct and MIMO strategies and discusses their respective limitations to the problem of long-term time series prediction. It also proposes a new methodology that is a sort of intermediate way between the Direct and the MIMO technique. The paper presents the results obtained with the ESTSP 2007 competition dataset.},

However, their relationship to previous intake of pharmaceutical benzodiazepines has not been clearly established. In the present study, plasma levels of benzodiazepine receptor ligands (BZRLs) were measured using a sensitive radioreceptor assay in 12 control subjects with no evidence of hepatic, neurological or psychiatric illness, 11 cirrhotic patients without HE, 24 cirrhotic patients with moderate (grade I-II) HE and in 45 cirrhotic patients with severe (grade II-IV) HE. In addition, CSF concentrations of BZRLs were measured in 8 cirrhotic patients with HE and an equal number of age-matched controls. Recent intake (within 10 days) of pharmaceutical benzodiazepines was assessed by detailed review of medical files, and interviews with the patient, at least one family member as well as the pharmacist. Significantly increased plasma concentrations of BZRLs were observed in cirrhotic patients with severe encephalopathy (p < 0.02) compared to controls and to cirrhotic patients without (or with mild) neurological impairment. Increased plasma BZRLs could be accounted for by prior exposure to benzodiazepine medication in all cases. CSF concentrations of BZRLs in cirrhotic patients were not significantly different from control values. These findings do not support a role for "endogenous" benzodiazepines in the pathogenesis of HE in chronic liver disease but suggest that pharmaceutic benzodiazepines administered to cirrhotic patients as sedatives or as part of endoscopic work-up could have contributed to the neurological impairment in some patients.},

abstract = {Minimal hepatic encephalopathy is a syndrome caused by liver cirrhosis and accompanied by a broad spectrum of cognitive symptoms. The objective of the present study was to describe the prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients and to compare their cognitive performance with controls using standardized tests. Patients receiving medication or experiencing comorbidities associated with cognitive disorders were excluded. The final cohort was compared with a control-matched group using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), as well as Simple Drawing, Clock Drawing, Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Random Letter, Stroop, Trail-Making Test (TMT) A and B, Boston Naming, Category Verbal Fluency, Digit Span, Constructional Praxis, Processing Speed, and Similarities Tests. The results indicated no differences in the prevalence of cognitive complaints spontaneously reported by 29 patients with cirrhosis versus 22 healthy controls. The most affected tests included: MMSE (26.3 +/- 2 vs. 28.1 +/- 1.8 points; p = 0.004), learning (35.4 +/- 9 vs. 41 +/- 9.1 points; p = 0.041), retroactive interference (0.67 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.84 +/- 0.16 points; p = 0.004), and recognition (8.7 +/- 2.6 vs. 11.2 +/- 4.1 points; p = 0.024) in RAVLT, TMT-A (63.2 +/- 29.3 vs. 47.6 +/- 16.5 s; p = 0.029) and TMT-B (197.9 +/- 88.1 vs. 146.8 +/- 76.5 s; p = 0.03). No differences were observed with respect to age, gender, and education. In conclusion, MMSE proved to be a useful tool for detecting global cognitive impairment experienced by cirrhosis patients. Moreover, the most impaired cognitive functions were verbal episodic memory and information processing speed. These findings suggest that minimal hepatic encephalopathy represents a disorder that affects the medial temporal system and, possibly, the prefrontal cortex, and this requires further study.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) represents a nervous system disorder caused due to liver dysfunction. HE is broadly classified as acute/overt and moderate-minimal HE. Since HE syndrome severely affects quality of life of the patients and it may be life threatening, it is important to develop effective therapeutic strategy against HE. Mainly ammonia neurotoxicity is considered accountable for HE. Increased level of ammonia in the brain activates glutamate-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor (NMDAR) pathway leading to Ca2+ influx, energy deficit and oxidative stress in the post synaptic neurons. Moreover, NMDAR blockage has been found to be a poor therapeutic option, as this neurotransmitter receptor plays important role in maintaining normal neurophysiology of the brain. Thus, searching new molecular players in HE pathogenesis is of current concern. There is an evolving concept about roles of the trans-membrane channels in the pathogenesis of a number of neurological complications. Pannexin1 (Panx1) is one of them and has been described to be implicated in stroke, epilepsy and ischemia. Importantly, the pathogenesis of these complications relates to some extent with NMDAR over activation. Thus, it is speculated that HE pathogenesis might also involve Panx1. Indeed, some recent observations in the animal models of HE provide support to this argument. Since opening of Panx1 channel is mostly associated with the neuronal dysfunctions, down regulation of this channel could serve as a relevant therapeutic strategy without producing any serious side effects. In the review article an attempt has been made to summarize the current information on implication of Panx1 in the brain disorders and its prospects for being examined as pharmacological target in HE pathogenesis.},

HE was associated with no appreciable changes in the chromatographic pattern of gangliosides or the concentration of protein-bound sialic acid, but the syndrome was associated with a 20{\%} increase in lipid-bound sialic acid and, as assessed electrophoretically, an increase in the concentration of a protein with a molecular weight of about 70 kDa. Thus, changes in the composition of complex carbohydrates and protein in SPMs occur in a model of HE. The findings raise the possibility that nonhumoral factors, such as increased sialylation of glycolipids, contribute to the generation of abnormal neurotransmission in HE.},

abstract = {A decreased ratio of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) to aromatic amino acids (AAA) is considered an important pathogenetic factor in hepatic encephalopathy (HE). A relationship between the deranged BCAA/AAA ratio and dopaminergic dysfunction through the formation of "false" neurotransmitters has been postulated. The intermediate lobe of the pituitary is more pronounced in dogs than in humans and because it is primarily under dopaminergic inhibitory influence, it may serve as an indicator of alterations in dopaminergic neurotransmission. We investigated the effects of a diet with a high BCAA/AAA ratio (HR) and an isonitrogenous diet with a low BCAA/AAA ratio (LR) on several physical and biochemical parameters including pituitary function in dogs with portocaval shunts and 40{\%} hepatectomy and in sham-operated pair-fed controls, in a double-blind, randomized cross-over study. Portocaval-shunted dogs had hyperammonemia (33+/-3 microM (mean +/- SEM) before and 214+/-21 after surgery)) and signs of HE. Their BCAA/AAA ratio in plasma and CSF decreased from 4.3+/-0.3 and 2.3+/-0.3 before surgery to 1.3+/-0.1 and 0.5+/-0.1 after surgery, respectively. These parameters remained unaltered in the control dogs. The consumption of the LR diet was significantly higher than consumption of the HR diet. In the portocaval-shunted dogs, plasma ammonia concentration was higher on the HR diet than on the LR diet (344+/-52 v 246+/-45) and the HE grade was worse. The BCAA/AAA ratio remained abnormal in HE dogs during the feeding of both diets. The basal and haloperidol-stimulated release of alpha-melanotropin and cortisol in plasma were not significantly different between or within groups during any period. In contrast, urinary cortisol excretion was increased in the HE dogs after surgery (urinary cortisol:creatinine ratio (x10(-6)) 8.5+/-1.4 before and 30.4+/-8.9 after surgery). The basal plasma concentration of adrenocorticotropin in HE dogs was decreased after surgery (68.3+/-10.2 ng/L before and 40.8+/-4.4 after surgery). This indicates a non-pituitary-dependent hyperresponsiveness of the adrenals. We conclude from these results that chronic HE in dogs is not associated with an abnormal dopaminergic neurotransmission at least at the level of the pituitary, and that it is not the content of the dietary neutral amino acids but rather the total protein intake that may have a beneficial effect on HE.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is common in cirrhosis but its pathophysiologic basis remains undefined. We evaluated whether the presence of MHE was associated with severity of liver disease, ammonia levels or the presence of inflammation and assessed factors determining neuropsychological deterioration accompanying induction of hyperammonemia. METHODS: Eighty four cirrhotics were studied. A neuropsychological test battery was performed and blood taken for ammonia, WCC, CRP, nitrate/nitrite, IL-6 and amino acids, before and after, induction of hyperammonemia by administration of a solution mimicking the amino acid composition of haemoglobin (60) or placebo (24). RESULTS: The presence and severity of MHE were independent of severity of liver disease and ammonia concentration but markers of inflammation were significantly higher in those with MHE compared with those without. Induction of hyperammonemia produced deterioration in one or more neuropsychological tests by > or =1 SD in 73.3{\%}. This was independent of the magnitude of change in plasma ammonia and severity of liver disease but was significantly greater in those with more marked inflammation. CONCLUSION: Our data show that inflammation is an important determinant of the presence and severity of MHE. The change in neuropsychological function following induced hyperammonemia is greater in those with more severe inflammation.},

abstract = {Activities of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and cholinergic nerve-terminal marker enzymes glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and choline acetyltransferase (CAT) as well as the astrocytic enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS) were measured in homogenates of dissected brain tissue obtained at autopsy from nine cirrhotic patients dying in hepatic encephalopathy and an equal number of control subjects matched for age, agonal status, and time interval from death to freezing of autopsied material. GAD activities varied as a function of agonal status in control samples, confirming a previous report, but were unchanged in brain tissue from cirrhotic patients, suggesting no loss of integrity of presynaptic GABA nerve terminals in this disease. On the other hand, GS activities were selectively decreased by 25{\%} (P less than 0.01) in caudate nuclei of cirrhotic patients, reflecting, no doubt, the severe astrocytosis consistently observed in this brain structure. CAT activities, expressed per milligram of protein, were found to be increased by 30{\%} (P less than 0.01) in the prefrontal cortex of cirrhotic patients. Whether such changes result from a relative increase in CAT as a consequence of losses of astrocytic protein or reflect altered cholinergic function in hepatic encephalopathy associated with chronic liver disease awaits further study.},

abstract = {A robust neuroinflammatory response characterized by microglial activation and increased brain production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is common in acute liver failure (ALF). Mechanisms proposed to explain the neuroinflammatory response in ALF include direct effects of systemically-derived proinflammatory cytokines and the effects of brain lactate accumulation on pro-inflammatory cytokine release from activated microglia. Cell culture studies reveal a positive synergistic effect of ammonia and pro-inflammatory cytokines on the expression of proteins involved in glutamate homeostasis and in oxidative/nitrosative stress. Proinflammatory cytokines have the capacity to alter blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and preliminary studies suggest that the presence of infection in ALF results in rupture of the BBB and vasogenic brain edema. Treatments currently under investigation that are effective in prevention of encephalopathy and brain edema in ALF which are aimed at reduction of neuroinflammation in ALF include mild hypothermia, albumin dialysis systems, N-acetyl cysteine and the antibiotic minocycline with potent anti-inflammatory actions that are distinct from its anti-microbial properties.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neurologic disease associated with hepatic dysfunction. Astroglial and neuronal alterations have been described in the basal ganglia in HE. Our study was performed to determine whether such alterations are mediated by nitric oxide (NO), by using an experimental model of HE (portacaval anastomosis [PCA]). The expression of the NO synthases (nNOS and iNOS) and the production of nitrotyrosine (NT) were evaluated in the striatum of rats exposed to PCA for 1 and 6 months. The expression of nNOS in the striatal neurons of PCA rats was increased compared to controls. nNOS expression was also detectable in astrocytes after 6 months of exposure to PCA. Whereas astroglial cells in the normal striatum showed no iNOS expression, iNOS was expressed in the astrocytes of PCA brains, mainly in perivascular processes at 6 months PCA exposure (demonstrated by colocalization with GFAP). The increased expression of both the nNOS and iNOS isoforms in PCA rats might indicate a critical role for NO in the pathomechanism of HE. To study the potential cell damage caused by NO, the deposition of NT in PCA-rats was analysed. Nitrotyrosine was detected in neurons although it was mainly seen in the astrocytes of PCA brains, in which double immunolabelling showed NT to be colocalized with GFAP. Thus, the present study shows the induction of iNOS and NT in astrocytes, which increases with the duration of PCA exposure. This suggests that the induced astroglial production of NO during PCA might be one of the main factors contributing to HE.},

abstract = {It is well-known that liver cirrhosis is frequently accompanied by a wide range of neuropsychiatric abnormalities, including general and specific cognitive impairment. The aim of this study was to investigate which cognitive functions are selectively compromised in Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) and to clarify the relationship between clinically overt or nonovert HE and the different forms and degrees of decay in cognitive deficits. Twenty-two patients without overt HE and 12 patients who showed overt HE at the first level of severity, along with matched control subjects, were compared in several cognitive domains. The results showed significant differences in some measures of attention between patients with minimal HE (mHE) and patients with overt HE. There were also notable differences in verbal short-term memory between patients with mHE and healthy subjects. Thus, we can hypothesize that there is a linear diminution in short-term memory and attentional performance starting from healthy patients, moving toward patients with mHE, and finally progressing toward patients with the first grade of overt HE. There are two types of diminution that we noted: between patients with mHE and the overt form, the decline in the attentional domain was more evident, while between healthy subjects and mHE patients, short-term memory showed a more evident decline.},

Two packages (snow, Rmpi) stand out as particularly suited to general use on computer clusters. Packages for grid computing are still in development, with only one package currently available to the end user. For multi-core systems five different packages exist, but a number of issues pose challenges to early adopters.

We performed updated random effects meta-analyses to evaluate the evidence for non-absorbable disaccharides (lactulose and lactitol), rifaximin and branched chain amino acids (BCAA). A meta-analysis of randomized trials showed that, compared with placebo or no intervention, non-absorbable disaccharides have beneficial effects on HE manifestations and prevention of HE episodes. The addition of rifaximin to non-absorbable disaccharides versus rifaximin alone was more beneficial than non-absorbable disaccharides used alone on both outcome measures. Likewise, a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials found that oral BCAA supplements have beneficial effects on manifestations of HE compared with control supplements. The effect was found in a variety of clinical settings. No convincing effects of intravenous BCAA for episodic HE were identified. In conclusion, evidence-based treatment recommendations for patients with HE should include non-absorbable disaccharides combined with rifaximin or BCAA. Additional evidence is needed to evaluate the effect of combining all three interventions.},

abstract = {Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE) is a serious neuropsychiatric condition of both acute and chronic liver failure. Acute liver failure is characterized by rapid evolution of HE and by brain edema. Portal-Systemic encephalopathy (PSE) is particularly prevalent following treatment of portal hypertension or ascites by the TIPS procedure. Available evidence currently suggests that neurotransmission changes rather than brain energy failure are the primary cause of HE. Recent studies both in autopsied brain tissue from HE patients as well as in experimental animal models of HE reveal that liver failure results in altered expression of several genes coding for proteins having key roles in the control of neuronal excitability. Such alterations include decreased expression of the glutamate transporter GLT-1, and increased expression of monoamine oxidase (MAO-A isoform), the "peripheral-type" benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR) as well as constitutive neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Such changes result in altered protein expression and in increased extracellular brain glutamate, increased degradation of monoamine neurotransmitters, increased synthesis of neurosteroids with inhibitory properties, and increased production of nitric oxide (respectively) in brain in chronic liver failure. In the case of GLT-1, PTBR, and nNOS, alterations in expression result from exposure to ammonia and/or manganese, two neurotoxic agents shown previously to be increased in brain in liver failure.},

abstract = {Increased benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor density has been reported in brains of rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) due to galactosamine (GalN)-induced fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). These data were generated using detergent-Triton X-100-treated neural membranes. While performing further studies it was noted that the increase in BZ receptor density was not demonstrable when Triton X-100 preparation was not employed. Accordingly the binding of [3H] flunitrazepam, a BZ ligand, to neural membranes from cortices of normal rabbits and rabbits with HE due to (GalN)-induced FHF was studied with and without detergent preparation. Scatchard plot analysis of the binding data indicated that when no detergent was employed, the apparent affinity and density of BZ receptors were similar for control membranes and membranes from animals in HE. BZ receptors from animals in HE were shown to be more resistant to solubilization by Triton than control membranes. These findings (a) afford a potential explanation for the apparent increase in density of BZ receptors in this model when Triton treatment of neural membranes is utilized and (b) suggest that recent evidence for increased GABAergic tone in the syndrome of HE is not dependent on an increased density of BZ receptors.},

Results are collected in a scalable, distributed data store and returned to the interactive user session. We apply our approach to a forecasting application that fits a variety of models, prohibiting an analytical description of the statistical uncertainty associated with the overall forecast. To overcome this, we generate simulation-based uncertainty bands, which necessitates a large number of computationally intensive realizations. Our technique cut total run time by a factor of 300. Distributing the computation across many machines permits analysts to focus on statistical issues while answering questions that would be intractable without significant parallel computational infrastructure. We present real-world performance characteristics from our application to allow practitioners to better understand the nature of massively parallel statistical simulations in R. },

Ammonia has been considered central to its pathogenesis but recently an important role for its interaction with inflammatory responses and auto-regulation of cerebral hemodynamics has been suggested. Artificial liver support might be able to decrease ammonia and modulate inflammatory mediators and cerebral hemodynamics. Bioartificial liver support systems use hepatocytes in an extracorporeal device connected to the patient's circulation. Artificial liver support is intended to remove protein-bound toxins and water-soluble toxins without providing synthetic function. Both systems improve clinical and biochemical parameters and can be applied safely to patients. Clinical studies have shown that artificial liver support, especially albumin dialysis, is able to improve HE in acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure. Further studies are required to better understand the mechanism, however, artificial liver support can be added to the therapeutic bundle in treating HE.},

Moreover, a supranormal L-TRP hydroxylating activity in the brain suggests an induced enzymatic process in chronic HE. GTP-cyclohydrolase I (GTPCHI) and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) are two major factors besides L-TRP that are involved in regulating the brain L-TRP hydroxylating activity. We therefore determined the GTPCHI activity, the total biopterin and the BH4 concentrations in the neocortex and mesencephalon-pons of portacaval shunted (PCS) rats. The encephalopathic component in PCS rats was accounted for by studying open field behaviour. The acute effects of a single parenteral L-TRP challenge were also evaluated. The basal GTPCHI activities in PCS rats were decreased bu 50{\%} (p < 0.05) compared to controls in both investigated brain regions. No significant alterations in brain total biopterin or BH4 levels were present. The PCS rats exhibited a clearly reduced spontaneous locomotor activity. After the exogenous L-TRP load only a lower GTPCHI activity in the neocortex of PCS rats was recorded. We conclude that a perturbation in the brain biopterin metabolism is concomitantly present with behavioural abnormalities in the chronic PCS condition and that the acute effects of a superimposed L-TRP load do not aggravate these disturbances.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with increased ammonia levels in plasma and brain. Different treatment strategies have been developed to ameliorate the detrimental effects of the ammonia load. One such strategy is based on the finding of a low level of the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) in plasma of patients suffering from HE and the assumption that in particular isoleucine could be beneficial to brain energy metabolism as it is metabolized to the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate and precursor succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, respectively. This would enable de novo synthesis of glutamine via alpha-ketoglutarate and glutamate and at the same time stimulate oxidative metabolism. The present mini-review summarizes the metabolic basis for this hypothesis delineating studies in the brain in vivo as well as in cultured neural cells aimed at elucidating the metabolism of the BCAAs focusing on isoleucine. The conclusion is that isoleucine appears at least partially to act in this fashion albeit its metabolism is quantitatively relatively modest. In addition, a short section on the role of the BCAAs in synaptic ammonia homeostasis is included along with some thoughts on the role of the BCAAs in other pathologies such as cancer.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric disorder associated with either acute or chronic liver failure. More than two decades ago, the role of altered GABAergic neurotransmission was proposed following evidence of "increased GABAergic tone" in HE. Increased GABAergic tone was based on several observations: (i) Similarity of visual evoked response potential patterns between rabbits with galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure and animals treated with various allosteric agonists of the GABA receptor complex (GRC). (ii) Spontaneous activities of isolated Purkinje neurons from rabbits with galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure are more depressed by GRC modulator compounds compared to normal animals. (iii) Flumazenil, a high selective benzodiazepine antagonist at the GRC, ameliorates behavioral symptoms and EEG activity in some HE patients. Pathophysiological mechanisms put forward to explain increased GABAergic tone in HE include (1) increase in brain GABA content due to increased brain GABA uptake through altered permeability of the blood brain barrier, (2) alteration of the integrity of constituents of the GRC, and (3) increase of endogenous GRC modulators such as benzodiazepines (and more recently neurosteroids) with potent agonist properties at the GRC. Studies performed subsequently excluded alterations of either GABA content or GRC integrity in favor of increased brain concentrations of endogenous agonists. While the role of endogenous benzodiazepines remains controversial, the presence of neurosteroids with GABA agonist properties affords a plausible explanation for increased GABAergic tone in HE.},

abstract = {Neurocognitive dysfunction of varying degrees is common in patients with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis (HBV-RC) without overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE). However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these dysfunctions are not well understood. We sought to identify changes in the neural activity of patients with HBV-RC without OHE in the resting state by using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) method and to determine whether these changes were related to impaired cognition. Resting-state functional MRI data from 30 patients with HBV-RC and 30 healthy controls matched for age, sex, and years of education were compared to determine any differences in the ALFF between the two groups. Cognition was measured with the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES), and the relationship between these scores and ALFF variation was assessed. Compared with controls, patients showed widespread lower standardized ALFF (mALFF) values in visual association areas (bilateral lingual gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, and left inferior temporal gyrus), motor-related areas (bilateral precentral gyrus, paracentral lobule, and right postcentral gyrus), and the default mode network (bilateral cuneus/precuneus and inferior parietal lobule). Higher mALFF values were found in the bilateral orbital gyrus/rectal gyrus.

abstract = {The combination of Parkinson syndrome (PS) and prolonged visually evoked potentials (VEPs) in a single patient with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has not been reported. A 52-year-old male with chronic HE developed PS in early 2001. Treatment with L-DOPA was only of minimal effect. In August 2001 he was admitted because of worsening PS and HE. There was anemia, hyperlipidaemia, markedly elevated liver-function-parameters, hyperammonemia, elevated resting-lactate, steatosis hepatis and hepatomegalia. VEPs showed markedly prolonged P100-latencies. Under L-DOPA, pramipexol, L-ornithin-L-aspartate, paromomycin-sulfate, and lactulose liver-function-parameters normalized and PS markedly improved. In February 2003, VEPs were normal. L-DOPA was discontinued by the patient in April 2003 and pramipexol in December 2003. Since then PS did not recur. This case shows that HE may go along with reversible PS and prolonged VEPs. Under adequate therapy liver-function-parameters and VEPs normalize and PS disappears.},

abstract = {Many recent statistical applications involve inference under complex models, where it is computationally prohibitive to calculate likelihoods but possible to simulate data. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is devoted to these complex models because it bypasses evaluations of the likelihood function using comparisons between observed and simulated summary statistics. We introduce the R abc package that implements several ABC algorithms for performing parameter estimation and model selection. In particular, the recently developed non-linear heteroscedastic regression methods for ABC are implemented. The abc package also includes a cross-validation tool for measuring the accuracy of ABC estimates, and to calculate the misclassification probabilities when performing model selection. The main functions are accompanied by appropriate summary and plotting tools. Considering an example of demographic inference with population genetics data, we show the potential of the R package. R is already widely used in bioinformatics and several fields of biology. The R abc package will make the ABC algorithms available to the large number of R users. abc is a freely available R package under the GPL license, and it can be downloaded at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abc/index.html.},

abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful and versatile tool for the investigation of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). This nuclear medicine imaging technique produces quantitative images of the distribution of a radiopharmaceutical at one or more times after its administration. Thus, PET images can be used as data in mathematical models of physiologically important processes, including cerebral blood flow, an index of neural activity, or glucose and ammonia metabolism. Using PET, we have demonstrated abnormalities in all of these processes in patients, even though many had only minimal HE. In HE patients we have found increases in the cerebral ammonia metabolic rate, because of hyperammonemia and an increase in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to ammonia and abnormal patterns of blood flow and glucose metabolism. In a recent collaborative study, alterations in the resting glucose metabolic rate were found to have significant correlations with a variety of neuropsychological tests used to detect mild HE including Trailmaking A and B, symbol-digit, and other tests. Activation techniques have not yet been applied to map sites affected by HE, but recent data using the paced serial auditory addition test and an auditory continuous performance task have proven to be sensitive indicators in minimally impaired patients. The full potential of PET to evaluate neurotransmitter function is as yet unrealized.},

Cerebrospinal fluid from rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy caused 36.1 +/- 5.03{\%} displacement of 3H-Ro 15-1788 specific binding to cortical benzodiazepine receptors, compared to 11.7 +/- 0.76{\%} in control animals (P less than 0.01).

Brain glutamate concentrations are reduced in patients who died in hepatic coma as well as in experimental HE, astrocytic reuptake of glutamate is compromised in liver failure and postsynaptic glutamate receptors (both NMDA and non-NMDA subclasses) are concomitantly reduced in density. Recent studies in experimental acute liver failure suggest reduced capacity of the astrocytic glutamate transporter in this condition. Together, this data suggests that neuron-astrocytic trafficking of glutamate is impared in HE. Other significant alterations of neuroactive amino acids in HE include a loss of taurine from brain cells to extracellular space, a phenomenon which could relate both to HE and to brain edema in acute liver failure. Increased concentrations of benzodiazepine-like compounds have been reported in human and experimental HE. Clinical trials with the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil reveal a beneficial effect in some patients with HE; the mechanism responsible for this effect, however, remains to be determined.},

We analyzed the presence of mild cognitive impairment (CI) by using the PHES battery of psychometric tests and measured the levels of ammonia and of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-18 in blood of patients with different types of liver or dermatological diseases resulting in different grades of hyperammonemia and/or inflammation. The study included patients with 1) liver cirrhosis, showing hyperammonemia and inflammation; 2) non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) showing inflammation but not hyperammonemia; 3) non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) showing inflammation and very mild hyperammonemia; 4) psoriasis, showing inflammation but not hyperammonemia; 5) keloids, showing both inflammation and hyperammonemia and 6) controls without inflammation or hyperammonemia. The data reported show that in patients with liver diseases, cognitive impairment may appear before progression to cirrhosis if hyperammonemia and inflammation are high enough. Five out of 11 patients with NASH, without liver cirrhosis, showed cognitive impairment associated with hyperammonemia and inflammation. Patients with keloids showed cognitive impairment associated with hyperammonemia and inflammation, in the absence of liver disease. Hyperammonemia or inflammation alone did not induce CI but the combination of certain levels of hyperammonemia and inflammation is enough to induce CI, even without liver disease.},

Three-hundred consecutive hospitalized cirrhotic patients were prospectively enrolled. Liver function, a complete neurocognitive assessment for the diagnosis of clinical or subclinical hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and parameters of nutritional status and muscle function were evaluated in each patient at admission. Clinically overt HE, at admission or in the last 12 months, or a diagnosis of minimal HE were significantly higher in cirrhotic patients with muscle depletion or decreased muscle strength. The fasting venous blood ammonia concentrations were also higher in this group. Muscle depletion was an independent risk factor at multivariate analysis both for overt and minimal HE. In conclusion cirrhotic patients with muscle depletion are at higher risk of HE and the amelioration of nutritional status is a possible goal to decrease the prevalence of neurocognitive alterations in these patients.},

abstract = {There is no "gold standard" for diagnosing hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis. In consequence, the presence of this condition, unless floridly overt, is often missed. As a result, the majority of patients are denied the benefits of treatment. There are a number of individual techniques, which access different aspects of cerebral function that can be used, singly or in combination, to provide diagnostic information in this condition, including mental state assessment, psychometric testing, electroencephalography, sensory and cognitive evoked potentials, and neuroimaging. These have been variously applied to the study of hepatic encephalopathy but fundamental differences in the essential aims of the studies, as well as differences in the patient populations and the acquisition and analysis of the data, have made comparisons difficult. Thus, there is no clear consensus as to the sensitivity, specificity, or validity of these tests when used alone or in combination. There are, however, a number of additional methods that could be used to analyze the electrophysiological data, and a number of alternative evoked potentials that could be measured to provide better diagnostic information. In addition, there are a number of techniques, such as critical flicker frequency and smooth pursuit eye movements, which have not yet been applied systematically in this condition and which may provide useful diagnostic information. Clearly the methods for assessing hepatic encephalopathy need to be reviewed, newer methods for analyzing the electrophysiological data and newer techniques for assessing alternative aspects of cerebral function need to be explored for their diagnostic utility. This process should aim at developing a multidimensional diagnostic tool.},

abstract = {Both acute and chronic liver failure induce cerebral complications known as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and thought to selectively involve brain astrocytes. Alterations of astrocytic-neuronal cross talk occurs affecting brain function. In acute liver failure, astrocyte undergo swelling, which results in increased intracranial pressure and may lead to brain herniation. In chronic liver failure, Alzheimer-type II astrocytosis is a characteristic change. Neurosteroids (NS) synthesized in the brain mainly by astrocytes independent of peripheral steroidal sources (adrenals and gonads) are suggested to play a role in HE. NS bind and modulate different types of membrane receptors. Effects on the gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)-A receptor complex are the most extensively studied. For example, the NS tetrahydroprogesterone (allopregnanolone), and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) are potent positive allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors. As a consequence of modulation of these receptors, NS are well-known to modulate inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Some NS bind to intracellular receptors, and in this way may also regulate gene expression. In HE, it has been well documented that neurotransmission and gene expression alterations occur during the progression of the disease. This review summarizes findings of relevance for the involvement of NS in human and experimental HE.},

abstract = {Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric disorder that often occurs as a consequence of acute or chronic liver failure. Previous reports have suggested that alterations in amino acid neurotransmission, particularly glutamate, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of HE. The objectives of the present study were to test the hypothesis that extracellular glutamate concentration is increased during HE, and to determine if flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, alters the extracellular concentration of glutamate during HE. The experimental approach involved using microdialysis probes to measure rat hippocampal extracellular glutamate concentration. HE was brought about as a result of thioacetamide-induced liver failure. Thioacetamide produced behavioral and metabolic effects, such as somnolence, hyperventilation and hyperammonemia, consistent with stage three HE. Comparison with saline-treated rats demonstrated that HE was associated with a significant increase (p = 0.010) in extracellular hippocampal glutamate concentration. Administration of flumazenil caused a transient increase in arousal level, but did not affect the increase in glutamate concentration (p = 0.93). These results corroborate the theory that glutamate neurotransmission is altered during HE and suggest that the flumazenil arousal of HE rats is not mediated by a change in extracellular glutamate concentration.},

These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

abstract = {Disturbed body nitrogen homeostasis due to impaired hepatic urea synthesis leads  to an alteration in inter-organ ammonia trafficking, resulting in hyperammonemia. Glutamine (Gln) synthase is the alternative pathway for ammonia detoxification. Gln taken up by several organs is split by the intramitochondrial phosphate-activated enzyme glutaminase (PAG) into glutamate (Glu) and ammonia. In cirrhotic patients with portosystemic intrahepatic shunt, the main source of systemic hyperammonemia is the small intestine, and ammonia derives mainly from Gln deamidation. Recently, PAG has been found increased in cirrhotics showing minimal hepatic encephalopathy and, therefore, could be implicated in the production of systemic hyperammonemia in these patients. Intestinal PAG activity correlates with psychometric test and magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings. Moreover, nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor seem to be the major factors regulating intestinal ammonia production in cirrhotics. In the brain, PAG localized into the astrocytes is responsible for ammonia and free-radical production. The blockade of PAG, using 6-oxo-5-norleucine, avoids the toxic effects of Gln accumulation in the brain. These data support an important role for intestinal and brain glutaminase in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and could be a new target for future therapies.},

Thirty-five cirrhotic patients with a history of HE and their caregivers (n = 31) were enrolled. Patients underwent evaluation of HE (clinical, psychometry and electroencephalography), quality of life (SF36 questionnaire), and awareness of HE/treatment on an ad hoc questionnaire (QAE). Caregivers underwent the QAE plus the Caregiver Burden Inventory. On the day of study, 7 patients were unimpaired, 8 had minimal and 20 low-grade overt HE. Of the patients, 37 {\%} were aware of previous HE, 6 {\%} of being on treatment and 6 {\%} understood treatment effects. Of the caregivers, 48 {\%} were aware of previous HE, 6 {\%} of their relative being on treatment and 6 {\%} understood treatment effects. Significant correlations were observed between neuropsychiatric status/linear HE indices and both the patients' quality of life and the caregivers' burden. In conclusion, HE awareness was poor in both patients and caregivers, most likely in relation to insufficient/inadequate provision of information.},

The model is based on a simple weight-driven dynamics and a weights' reinforcement mechanism coupled to the local network growth. That coupling can be generalized in order to include the effect of additional randomness and non-linearities which can be present in real-world networks. The model generates weighted graphs exhibiting the statistical properties observed in several real-world systems. In particular, the model yields a non-trivial time evolution of vertices properties and scale-free behavior with exponents depending on the microscopic parameters characterizing the coupling rules. Very interestingly, the generated graphs spontaneously achieve a complex hierarchical architecture characterized by clustering and connectivity correlations varying as a function of the vertices' degree.},

abstract = {Networked structures arise in a wide array of different contexts such as technological and transportation infrastructures, social phenomena, and biological systems. These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analytical and numerical study for the spreading of infections in complex population networks with acquired immunity. We show that the large connectivity fluctuations usually found in these networks strengthen considerably the incidence of epidemic outbreaks. Scale-free networks, which are characterized by diverging connectivity fluctuations, exhibit the lack of an epidemic threshold and always show a finite fraction of infected individuals. This particular weakness, observed also in models without immunity, defines a new epidemiological framework characterized by a highly heterogeneous response of the system to the introduction of infected individuals with different connectivity. The understanding of epidemics in complex networks might deliver new insights in the spread of information and diseases in biological and technological networks that often appear to be characterized by complex heterogeneous architectures.},

We find that the connectivity structure of the Internet presents average quantities and statistical distributions settled in a well-defined stationary state. The large-scale properties are characterized by a scale-free topology consistent with previous observations. Correlation functions and clustering coefficients exhibit a remarkable structure due to the underlying hierarchical organization of the Internet. The study of the Internet time evolution shows a growth dynamics with aging features typical of recently proposed growing network models. We compare the properties of growing network models with the present real Internet data analysis.},

abstract = {We present a general model for the growth of weighted networks in which the structural growth is coupled with the edges' weight dynamical evolution. The model is based on a simple weight-driven dynamics and a weights' reinforcement mechanism coupled to the local network growth. That coupling can be generalized in order to include the effect of additional randomness and non-linearities which can be present in real-world networks. The model generates weighted graphs exhibiting the statistical properties observed in several real-world systems. In particular, the model yields a non-trivial time evolution of vertices properties and scale-free behavior with exponents depending on the microscopic parameters characterizing the coupling rules. Very interestingly, the generated graphs spontaneously achieve a complex hierarchical architecture characterized by clustering and connectivity correlations varying as a function of the vertices' degree.},

abstract = {We have assessed the current state of knowledge relative to methods used in assessing sub-tidal benthic habitat quality and the classification of benthic habitats. While our main focus is on marine habitat, we extensively draw on knowledge gained in freshwater systems where benthic assessment procedures are at an advanced stage of maturity. We found a broad range of sophistication/complication in terms of the methods applied in assessing and mapping benthic habitats. The simplest index or metric involved some assessment of species richness, while the most complicated required utilizing multi-variate analysis. The simplest mapping attempts equated physical substrate with benthic habitat while the most sophisticated relied on extensive environmental preference and groundtruth data for species of concern. The leading edge of methods for benthic habitat mapping involves combining the advances in optical and acoustic methods that allow for routine classifying and mapping of the seafloor with biological and habitat data for species of concern. The objective of this melding of dispirit methods is to produce benthic habitat maps with broad system wide coverage and sound biological underpinning. It is clear that the disparity in information density between the physical and biological sides of the equation currently hinder applicability and acceptability of benthic habitat mapping efforts. In addition to the lack of basic information on the biological and environmental tolerances of targeted species, the proliferation of metrics for characterizing and assessing biological conditions further clouds the usefulness of any broad scale mapping attempt. The problem of data density mismatch between physical and biological methods will likely not be solved until acoustic methods can routinely resolve the elusive biological components that make a physical substrate a habitat.},

    The ocean meets many overlapping needs which leaves no truly available space.
•

        
    Each location of interest is unique and requires targeted research for siting MRE.
•

        
    Stakeholder outreach is necessary to avoid or mitigate conflict when siting MRE.
•

        
    Ethnography creates key spatial data to incorporate community use in a GIS.

abstract = {This paper presents the definition of a Sustainability Index for the co-location in marine areas of offshore wind farms and aquaculture plans. The development of the index is focused on the application of MCE technique based on physical constraints and biological parameters that are directly linked to the primary production. The relevant physical factors considered are wind velocity and depth range (which directly governs the choice of the site for energy production and for offshore technology), the relevant biological parameters are SST, SST anomaly and CHL-a concentration (as a measurement of the productivity). The further development of the technique, already used in open water aquaculture localization, consists in converting raw data into sustainability scores, which have been combined using additive models, in order to define the overall sustainability. The study area used to implement the computation of the Sustainability Index (SI) was identified in the Danish portion of the Baltic Sea and in the western part of the Danish North Sea. Results on the spatial distribution of the SI underline different responses as a function of the physical and biological main influencing parameters.},

Spurred by the promising potential of these resources and an improving policy environment, efforts are under way in different offshore areas to assess resource potential, examine various technical approaches, and install renewable energy devices. Obstacles to development of this industry remain, and include technical difficulties, potential environmental impacts, and lack of funding.

@article{Diaz2004,
abstract = {We have assessed the current state of knowledge relative to methods used in assessing sub-tidal benthic habitat quality and the classification of benthic habitats. While our main focus is on marine habitat, we extensively draw on knowledge gained in freshwater systems where benthic assessment procedures are at an advanced stage of maturity. We found a broad range of sophistication/complication in terms of the methods applied in assessing and mapping benthic habitats. The simplest index or metric involved some assessment of species richness, while the most complicated required utilizing multi-variate analysis. The simplest mapping attempts equated physical substrate with benthic habitat while the most sophisticated relied on extensive environmental preference and groundtruth data for species of concern. The leading edge of methods for benthic habitat mapping involves combining the advances in optical and acoustic methods that allow for routine classifying and mapping of the seafloor with biological and habitat data for species of concern. The objective of this melding of dispirit methods is to produce benthic habitat maps with broad system wide coverage and sound biological underpinning. It is clear that the disparity in information density between the physical and biological sides of the equation currently hinder applicability and acceptability of benthic habitat mapping efforts. In addition to the lack of basic information on the biological and environmental tolerances of targeted species, the proliferation of metrics for characterizing and assessing biological conditions further clouds the usefulness of any broad scale mapping attempt. The problem of data density mismatch between physical and biological methods will likely not be solved until acoustic methods can routinely resolve the elusive biological components that make a physical substrate a habitat.},
