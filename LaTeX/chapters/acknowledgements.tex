		I would like to thank my advisors Martin Shields and Stephan Weiler for their support in my process of honing my research interests and my struggle to bring this research to fruition.  I would also like to thank my committee members David Mushinski and Steven Leisz for their support with some of the more technical aspects of my research.  I would also like to thank my parents, Glenn and Jan Mueller for their unending love and support both emotionally and intellectually throughout my academic career, and for instilling a sense of curiosity and wonder that led me in the direction of research as a career.  Finally, I'd like to thank my brothers, Starke and Graham for their love and support.
